  "content": "Renowned market expert Ajay Bagga on Monday warned that the India-US trade deal is unlikely to materialise in the near term, flagging rising risks for India’s export-linked jobs and services sector, even as the Centre pushed back against speculation over delays in the talks.\n\n“I don’t foresee a trade deal. They’re making an example out of India,” Bagga told NDTV Profit in an exclusive interaction, saying he saw no urgency from the US side to conclude the agreement.\n\nCentre rejects speculation on delay\n\nThe remarks come a day after Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal urged confidence in India’s negotiating position, following the Ministry of External Affairs’ rejection of claims that the deal stalled because Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not call US President Donald Trump.\n\nResponding to comments by US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick that talks with India failed while Washington moved ahead with other countries, Goyal said: “Trust your country, your motherland, not foreign statements.”\n\nJob losses and second-order effects\n\nBagga warned that the absence of a trade deal could trigger second-order effects across labour-intensive sectors.\n\n“It is a very big risk for India,” he said, adding that job losses could emerge in textiles, gems and jewellery, and leather. He flagged a larger risk to India’s services exports, which account for a significant share of the country’s external earnings.\n\nCause and effect: A prolonged stalemate - continued tariff pressure and uncertainty - weaker export competitiveness - employment stress in key sectors.\n\nTariffs linked to geopolitics\n\nBagga said the 25 percent excess punitive tariff on India could be rolled back only under specific geopolitical conditions.\n\n“The 25 percent excess tariff could be removed if there is a Russia–Ukraine peace deal,” he said, suggesting trade outcomes are increasingly tied to global political settlements rather than bilateral economics.\n\nCall for a stopgap arrangement\n\nEven if a comprehensive pact remains elusive, Bagga said India should push for an interim solution.\n\n“India needs to conclude some kind of a transient agreement, even if a trade deal doesn’t happen,” he told NDTV Profit, while expressing doubts over any movement given what he described as a “very aggressive Trump administration” following the Venezuelan crisis.\n\nFed investigation raises market concerns\n\nBagga also criticised the criminal investigation involving US Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell, calling it a “huge disappointment.”\n\n“It’s a criminal investigation against a sitting central bank governor,” Bagga said, adding that Powell’s description of it as a political decision was deeply concerning.\n\nIn a formal statement, Powell said the threat of criminal charges stemmed from the Fed setting interest rates based on economic assessments rather than presidential preferences, warning of risks to monetary policy independence.\n\nMarkets and geopolitics in focus\n\nBagga said markets would closely watch the fallout, particularly in bonds. “Last time, around liberation day tariffs, bonds getting unstuck was how markets showed disappointment,” he said.\n\nHe also flagged rising geopolitical risk, saying US action against Iran appeared imminent, though not immediate. Iran, he said, is a well-armed, Russian-supported regime where regime change via aerial strikes would be unlikely.",
