We had shared that our entry-level salaries will have the elite Cardre earning 3X – 4X of the regular hires. That 3X- 4X is anywhere between Rs 18 lakhs to 22 lakhs.”\n\n“We have to be competitive to be able to attract the best of talents that we want for our elite cadre,” he added.\n\nIn July 2025, Sundararajan has shared that the elite cadre would be roughly about 15-20 per cent of the overall fresher hiring target, as the company would focus on quality and specialisation over quantity.\n\nAlso read:HCLTech says specialisation to drive fresher hiring, 'elite' cadres to get 4X higher pay\n\nInfosys is hiking salaries too\n\nNot just HCLTech, rival Infosys too recentlyraised its fresher salaries.\n\nAccording to social media posts and banners reviewed and verified byMoneycontrolin December, Infosys is set to launch an off-campus hiring drive for 2025 engineering and computer science graduates to recruit talent for specialised technology roles, with annual compensation ranging from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 21 lakh.\n\nHow many freshers will HCLTech hire in FY26?\n\nHCLTech closed Q3 with a marginalheadcount decline of 261 employees, taking its total employee base to 2,26,379 at the end of Q3FY26.\n\nThe sequential dip came despite the company adding 2,852 freshers during the quarter, indicating that overall workforce movement was shaped by attrition and selective rationalisation rather than a broad-based hiring pullback.\n\nTotal fresher addition for the fiscal year 2026 now stands at 10,032, which is almost two-thirds hirgher than what HCLTech had on boarded in the same period last year.\n\n“That's one of the targets that we had set at the beginning of this fiscal that our fresher addition this year will be significantly higher compared to last year,” Sundararajan said.\n\nVoluntary attrition eased further to 12.4 percent on a last-twelve-month basis, down from 13.2 percent a year ago, suggesting improving employee retention even as net headcount stayed in the red.\n\nThe Noida-headquartered company reportednet profit decline of 11 percent year-on-yearto Rs 4,076 crore. Although consolidated revenue increased 13.3 per cent from a year earlier to Rs 33,872 crore in the quarter ending December 31.\n\nThe company has also revised its full-year revenue growth guidance to be between 4-4.5 percent YoY in CC terms. Services revenue growth is expected to be between 4.75 percent and 5.25 percent YoY in CC.\n\nEBIT margin or operating margin will be between 17.0 per cent - 18.0 per cent, excluding the one-time impact from the new labour laws.",
