  "content": "Shares of Tata Consultancy Services and HCL Technologies recovered from early losses to trade modestly higher by noon on Tuesday, as investors reassessed Q3 FY26 earnings and absorbed the initial wave of cautious brokerage commentary. The recovery in the IT majors' shares also followed a reversal in broader markets, with BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty erasing morning losses to edge into the green.\n\nTCS stockwas trading at Rs 3,258.1 around noon, up 0.6 percent, reversing losses seen in early trade amid concerns around limited growth visibility. The recovery followed a firm 1.1 percent rise in the previous session ahead of the earnings announcement -- this suggests that some investors may have used early weakness to selectively add positions.\n\nAlso read|TCS stock outlook cautious after Q3 results; brokerages flag weak growth visibility\n\nHCL Technologiesshares also clawed back losses to trade 0.15 percent higher at Rs 1,670.1 by midday. The stock had fallen more than 2 percent in the morning trade after its Q3 results, despite a strong operational performance and a guidance upgrade, as brokerages flagged constraints on near-term upside.\n\nThe intraday rebound in both stocks points to stabilising sentiment after initial post-results selling. In both cases, analysts broadly acknowledged steady execution, healthy deal pipelines, and resilient margins. However, enthusiasm remained tempered by broader concerns around growth sustainability and near-term earnings momentum.\n\nAlso read|HCL Tech Q3 results review: Fundamentals improve, but brokerages cautious on near-term stock outlook\n\nFor TCS, brokerages highlighted muted international business trends, modest forward indicators, and limited clarity on a sharp growth acceleration, keeping most houses in neutral or cautious territory despite operational stability. For HCL Tech, analysts pointed to seasonality risks -- especially in the products business -- along with valuation comfort and historical post-results performance patterns as factors restraining near-term optimism.\n\nDespite the midday recovery, both stocks remain under pressure on a longer-term basis. TCS is still down over 24 percent over the past year, while HCL Tech has fallen more than 16 percent over the same period. The investor focus remains firmly on whether deal execution, demand momentum, and AI-led initiatives can translate into a more durable growth recovery.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
