Some additional deductions may be given to them,\" Garg has been cited in an interaction withANI.\n\nPointing to existing provisions, Garg said there is growing demand to raise the current limits on deductions for interest income from bank deposits and small savings schemes. \"A vast majority of individuals are saying this should be increased,\" he stated, noting that higher exemptions could help senior citizens cope with inflation and rising living costs.\n\nGarg said the Centre is more likely to fine-tune the new tax regime rather than announce \"path-breaking or huge changes\", partly due to fiscal constraints. One possible targeted measure, he said, could be the inclusion of employer-driven provident fund deductions within the new tax regime. \"Provident fund contributions are structured through the employer and do not require additional proofs. This could help bridge gaps between the old and new regimes without increasing compliance,\" he said.\n\nHe also flagged the standard deduction as an area where limited relief could be offered. “This is one area that can see some tweaks,\" Garg said, adding that the standard deduction under the new tax regime could be increased by Rs 25,000 or more, providing relief to salaried taxpayers without altering slab rates.\n\nOn tax rates, Garg said significant changes were unlikely. \"From a rate perspective, I do not see much change,\" he said, though he added that there could be \"certain tweaks\" on the surcharge front, amid demands for marginal reductions.\n\nGarg also highlighted the Centre's continued push towards digitisation and ease of compliance. Referring to the Annual Information Statement (AIS) and Tax Information Statement (TIS), he said that these auto-generated reports, available on the income tax portal, have made return filing easier. \"At least 50-60 per cent of the information is already pre-filled,\" he said.\n\n#WATCH| Delhi | Tarun Garg, Director, Tax, at Deloitte India, says, \"When we saw in the last few years the budget speech by the finance minister, she had clearly promised that there will be changes and a specific focus of the government on the digitisation and ease of…pic.twitter.com/mKNzWsSjCg— ANI (@ANI)January 18, 2026\n\nHowever, he cautioned taxpayers to carefully verify the details. \"You need to check whether the information is correctly populated, as errors or duplication could lead to the same income being taxed twice,\" Garg said.\n\nOverall, he said, Budget 2026 is expected to prioritise targeted relief and administrative efficiency over broad-based personal tax reforms.\n\nThe Union Budget for 2026 will be presented in Parliament at 11 am on February 1, with Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla confirming the schedule earlier this month. February 1 has, in recent years, become the fixed date for the annual Budget presentation, a practice that was also followed for the Union Budget 2025.\n\nThe upcoming Budget will be Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s ninth consecutive Union Budget, placing her among the longest-serving finance ministers in terms of uninterrupted Budget presentations.\n\nThe Budget documents are prepared by the Department of Economic Affairs in the Finance Ministry, which undertakes the extensive annual exercise of compiling estimates of government expenditure and revenue. Beyond detailing the Centre’s fiscal position, the Union Budget also lays out policy priorities, proposed financial schemes and spending plans for the forthcoming financial year.",
