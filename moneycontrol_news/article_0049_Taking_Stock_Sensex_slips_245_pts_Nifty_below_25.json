The Nifty ended 67 points lower, while the Sensex was down by 245 points. Among sectors, Metal and PSU Bank indices rallied over 2 percent, whereas the IT index lost the most, shedding over 1 percent. Technically, after a muted open, the market registered narrow-range activity. On the lower side, it found support near 25,600/83200, while intraday profit booking was seen near 25,800/83800.\n\nWe are of the view that the intraday market texture is non-directional; perhaps traders are waiting for either side to breakout. On the higher side, above 25,800/83800, the market could move up to 25,880-25,900/84000-84200. On the flip side, below 25,600/83200, selling pressure is likely to accelerate. If it falls below this level, it could retest the levels of 25,500-25,450/83000-82800.\n\nGaurav Garg, Lemonn Markets Desk\n\nThe benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty witnessed sharp intraday volatility on Wednesday as caution prevailed amid sustained foreign fund outflows and global tariff-related concerns. After slipping to early lows, domestic markets pared most of their losses on the back of selective value buying and traded largely flat by mid-afternoon.\n\nThe Sensex fell to a low of 83,185.20 before recovering nearly 350 points to trade at 83,505.56, down 0.15 percent, while the Nifty hovered near the 25,700 level at 25,692.30, lower by 0.16 percent. Buying interest emerged in pockets such as metals, oil and gas, and consumer durables, helping limit the downside after recent corrections.\n\nMarket sentiment remains fragile, with both indices having declined in six of the last seven sessions amid concerns over US tariff measures, geopolitical tensions and persistent foreign portfolio outflows. FPIs have sold nearly â‚¹16,600 crore worth of equities so far in January, following heavy outflows in 2025. Additional volatility was driven by the advancement of the weekly derivatives expiry to Wednesday, while positive cues from Asian markets provided some support.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the Nifty managed to hold above the 25,620â€“25,715 support zone. A sustained move above 25,715 could trigger a recovery towards 26,020, while a break below 25,600 may open the downside towards 25,300.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
