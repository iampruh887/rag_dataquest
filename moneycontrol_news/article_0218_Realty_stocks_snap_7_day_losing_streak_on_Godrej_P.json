  "content": "The shares of real estate companies rose in trade on January 16, pushing the Nifty Realty index into the green after a seven-session losing streak.\n\nTheNifty Realty indexgained more than 2 percent to hit intraday high of 867.65 on Friday, before paring some gains. The index closed 0.35 percent higher at 853.\n\nPrestige Estateswere the top gainer on the index, rising nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 1,524.10 apiece. This comes after the company announced that it has recorded pre-sales worth Rs 4,183.6 crore during the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026, marking a 30 percent YoY growth.\n\nFor the April-December period, the company’s pre-sales surged 122 percent YoY to Rs 22,327.3 crore, marking the highest sales ever achieved by the company and surpassing its previous full-year peak sales.\n\nThe firm also announced the launch of Evergreen at Prestige Raintree Park in Whitefield, Bengaluru.\n\nMacrotech Developers(Lodha), Oberoi Realty and Godrej Properties shares followed, rising around 1 percent each.Godrej Propertieson January 15 announced that it has emerged as the largest listed residential real estate developer in India in 2025 for the second consecutive year, based on key operating metrics of booking value and cash collections.\n\nThe firm sold 16,428 homes with a total saleable area of 27.26 million sq. ft. in 2025, supported by 41 successful project launches across India.

According to analysts, the IT layoffs have impacted housing demand in key areas, thereby impacting the stocks. IT layoffs are likely to be the major reason for the low demand in the luxury segment of urban centers like Bangalore and Hyderabad as they will be discouraging the high-income buyers, said Shashank Gupta, Director, RPS Group.\n\nHe added that mid-to-premium housing sales, which have already dropped 15 percent year-on-year, will continue to be affected negatively as the professionals will not be willing to upgrade, opting instead to rent amid such job uncertainties.\n\n\"The market has whispered to the executives with Nifty Realty down by 20% from the peaks and talking about the disruption posed by the AI, which also indicates that 30% of the IT jobs that are luxury demand would get stifled due to the automation by 2027. The stock corrections that are expected to be around 5-7% are dependent on the RBI rate cuts and policy revamps that could fuel the market by the second quarter of 2026,\" the analyst said.\n\nKeshav Mangla, GM Business Development at Forteasia Realty, cited Anarock data to explain that financial tech layoffs of more than 1 lakh since 2024 have already resulted in a 12 percent drop in the demand for Tier-1 cities, thus resulting in developers' difficulties in managing cash flows and having to sell off their inventory.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",
