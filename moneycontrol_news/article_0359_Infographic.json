However, early-stage deals would rebound faster and niche and emerging sectors would gain prominence over the next 12-18 months.\n\nThe world's second-largest economy is slowing down. And that has sent alarm bells ringing around the world. In fact, if Nomura is to be believed, the downcycle has just started.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India's net forward position dropped by a massive $18 billion in June as the central bank went short on the dollar in the 1-month segment.\n\nChina sold a massive $94 billion worth of US treasuries in the year to July, data from the US treasury department shows.\n\nFaster adoption of external benchmark linked lending rate (EBLR) is expected to aid transmission of policy rates on to lending rates quickly and boost margins for banks.\n\nFY23 may be the year when Life Insurance Corporation's market share losing to private life insurers finally slow down.\n\nIndian consumers are more optimistic than before about the prospects of employment and income. But inflation is adding a layer of caution when it comes to spending.\n\nHousehold inflation expectations have moderated but only marginally and Indians are still worried that prices of food and services would continue to go up in the coming year.\n\nThe risk-off sentiment in global markets has resulted in outflows from Indian shores, puncturing valuations of listed firms here. This gives long-term investors an option to buy resilient balance sheets at a bargain.\n\nOn a cumulative basis, the pickup in rainfall was significant in July but the distribution was uneven. The month of August now holds the key for kharif output\n\nKey driver would be a sustained improvement in both quantum and dispersion of rainfall in the crucial month of August\n\nMoney supply growth has decelerated slightly on the back of a slowdown in bank deposit growth.\n\nLiquidity surplus is falling faster than anticipated but this fall is also uneven across the banking system, shown by sporadic borrowings at repo auctions and a consistent fall in standing deposit facility subscription.\n\nThe real effective exchange rate captures the competitiveness of the rupee against a basket of currencies.\n\nThe hunt for deposits would intensify among banks which could push up retail deposit rates further.\n\nEconomists expect that the festival season during the second half of the year would help in keeping the trend robust. The upshot is that tariffs are likely to see upside pressure.\n\nA recession may seem imminent in the US but signs of contraction are yet to show up on the balance sheets of banks there.\n\nCrude oil prices have come off sharply from record highs which is likely to have a favourable effect on inflation.\n\nSix months since the central bank vowed to reduce the liquidity glut, the surplus is reducing slowly.\n\nIndia’s imports from Russia outstrip exports and the trade deficit with the country has increased over the past two years. As of March, the trade deficit has more than doubled.\n\nSensex TodayBharat Coking Coal Share PriceMumbai BMC Election ResultsMaharashtra Election ResultsInfosys Share PricePune Election ResultsOld Tax RegimeNobel Peace Prize medalGold PriceAmazon Great Republic Day Sale\n\nBusinessMarketsStocksIndia NewsCity NewsEconomyMutual FundsPersonal FinanceIPO NewsStartups\n\nHomeCurrenciesCommoditiesPre-MarketIPOGlobal MarketBonds\n\nHomeLoans up to 50 LakhsCredit Cards Lifetime FreeFinance TrackerNewFixed DepositsFixed Deposit ComparisonFixed Income\n\nHomeMC 30Top Ranked FundsETFsMutual Fund Screener\n\nIncome Tax CalculatorEMI CalculatorRetirement PlanningGratuity CalculatorPetrol Price in IndiaDiesel Price in IndiaIFSC Code\n\nNews18FirstpostCNBC TV18News18 HindiCricketnextOverdrive\n\nAbout UsContact UsAdvisory AlertAdvertise with UsSupportDisclaimerPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyTerms & ConditionsFinancial Terms (Glossary)SitemapInvestors\n\nCopyright © Network18 Media & Investments Limited.
