  "content": "When people leave a job, money is often the most confusing part. Gratuity, severance, notice pay, final settlement. Everything gets lumped together, and that’s where misunderstandings start.\n\nSeverance pay and gratuity may both show up when employment ends, but they are not interchangeable. Treating them as the same can lead to wrong expectations and disappointment at the exit stage.\n\nGratuity is about how long you stayed\n\nGratuity exists to reward long service. If you complete the minimum required years of continuous employment, the employer is required to pay it. This applies whether you resign, retire, or are terminated, unless the exit is for serious misconduct.\n\nOnce eligibility is met, the employer doesn’t have much choice. The amount follows a set formula. That’s why gratuity is relatively predictable.\n\nSeverance is about how you lost the job\n\nSeverance is usually paid when the employer initiates the exit. Layoffs, redundancy, restructuring, or shutdowns are typical situations where severance comes into play.\n\nIf you resign on your own, severance is usually not offered. Even in layoffs, severance depends on company policy or what’s written in your contract. Some companies are generous. Some are not. Some negotiate. Some don’t.\n\nThere is no universal rule.\n\nWho controls the payout matters\n\nGratuity is governed by law. Severance is governed by internal policy or contract terms.\n\nThat difference changes everything. With gratuity, disputes are usually about calculation. With severance, disputes are often about entitlement itself.\n\nTwo employees leaving the same organisation can receive very different severance outcomes, even with similar tenure.\n\nThe tax impact surprises many people\n\nGratuity enjoys tax exemptions up to prescribed limits when paid as per law. For many employees, this makes a big difference to what they actually receive.\n\nSeverance pay is usually taxed as salary or compensation. The number may look large on paper, but tax can take a noticeable bite.\n\nThis is why gratuity often feels more meaningful in hand than severance of a similar amount.\n\nWhy one is easier to fight for\n\nIf gratuity is delayed or denied, employees have clear legal remedies. Authorities treat such cases seriously.\n\nSeverance is harder to challenge. If it’s discretionary or vaguely worded in policy, employees may have little leverage. This is why severance often becomes a negotiation point, while gratuity usually does not.\n\nThe mistake people make while planning exits\n\nMany employees assume severance will automatically be paid. They plan expenses around it. That’s risky.\n\nGratuity, if you’re eligible, is far more dependable. Severance should be treated as conditional unless it’s clearly guaranteed in writing.\n\nKnowing this difference early helps avoid stress when you’re already dealing with a job transition.",
