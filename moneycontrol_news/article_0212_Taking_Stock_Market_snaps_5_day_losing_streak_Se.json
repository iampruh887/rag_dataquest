After opening on a weak note, Nifty slipped into weakness in the early part of the session. A sharp recovery has emerged from the lows of 25473 levels and the market sustained the gains till the end.\n\nA long bull candle has been formed on the daily chart with long lower shadow. Technically, this market action is indicating significant turnaround in the market for the short term. This is positive indication one may expect further upside in the short term.\n\nThe underlying trend of Nifty seems to have turned up post sharp weakness of last week. Having recovered from the key lower levels decisively, Nifty could advance towards the next hurdle of 26000-26100 levels in the next few sessions.\n\nShrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities\n\nToday, the benchmark indices witnessed a sharp recovery from the lower levels. The Nifty ended 107 points higher, while the Sensex was up by 302 points. Among sectors, the Metal Index outperformed today, rallying over 2 percent, whereas the Realty and Media indices shed over 1 percent. Technically, after an early morning intraday sharp selloff, the market took support near 25,500/82,700 and bounced back sharply. From the day's lowest point, the market bounced back over 300/1,200 points, which is largely positive.\n\nWe are of the view that the intraday market texture is positive, but buy on dips and sell on rallies would be the ideal strategy for day traders. On the downside, 25,650/83,500 and 25,600/83,300 would act as key support zones, while 25,900-25,950/84,300-84,500 could serve as immediate resistance areas for the bulls. However, below 25,600/83,300, sentiment could change. If that happens, traders may consider exiting their long positions.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
