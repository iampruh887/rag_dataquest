  "content": "Most homebuyers focus on property prices, down payments and EMIs. Fewer pay attention to the number that banks look at first. Your credit score. If it is comfortably above 800, you are not just another applicant. You are someone banks actively want on their books.\n\nThat matters more than people realise.\n\nWhy banks care so much about the 800 mark\n\nFor lenders, a borrower with an 800-plus score is predictable. They pay on time, they do not stretch themselves recklessly, and they usually do not need constant follow-ups. Internally, many banks classify such customers as low-risk even before looking at income or employer details.\n\nThis often shows up as a lower spread over the benchmark lending rate. Sometimes it shows up as faster approvals, fewer questions or even a willingness to match a competing bank’s offer. Over a long-tenure home loan, even a small interest rate difference can translate into several lakhs saved.\n\nThe credit card habit that quietly holds scores back\n\nA common frustration among salaried professionals is being stuck at 760 or 780 despite never missing a payment. In many cases, the issue is not late payments at all. It is credit card utilisation.\n\nUsing a large portion of your available limit month after month tells lenders that you lean heavily on credit, even if you clear the bill every time. To move toward 800, banks prefer to see that you are using credit sparingly, not squeezing it.\n\nKeeping card usage closer to a quarter of your total limit makes a visible difference over time. Some people achieve this simply by asking for a higher limit and not increasing spending.\n\nAt higher scores, small mistakes matter more\n\nOnce you are close to 800, there is very little room for sloppiness. A missed minimum due, a delayed buy-now-pay-later instalment or a forgotten subscription-linked payment can pull your score down quickly.\n\nThis is where boring systems help. Auto-debits, calendar reminders and keeping a small buffer in your account reduce the risk of an avoidable slip. Banks reward consistency, not occasional perfection.\n\nWhy closing old cards can backfire\n\nIt feels sensible to shut unused credit cards. But older accounts add depth to your credit history, which matters more as you aim for an excellent score.\n\nIf an old card has no annual fee and has been managed well, keeping it alive and lightly used strengthens your profile. From a lender’s perspective, it shows that good behaviour has been sustained over time, not recently adopted.\n\nYour loan mix sends signals too\n\nA credit report dominated by short-term, unsecuredloanscan raise eyebrows. Too many personal loans, app-based credit lines or frequent consumer loans suggest dependence on easy credit.\n\nOn the other hand, successfully running a longer-term secured loan shows discipline. It tells the bank you understand what a multi-year commitment looks like and can stick with it.\n\nTiming your credit activity matters\n\nMany borrowers damage their own score just months before applying for a home loan. Multiple credit card or loan applications leave enquiry trails. Too many in a short span can temporarily drag scores down.\n\nIf a home purchase is planned, it helps to stop all other credit applications at least six months in advance. Let your profile look calm and settled when the bank checks it.\n\nWhat to focus on just before applying\n\nIn the final months, the goal is simple. Do nothing that creates noise. Keep utilisation low, pay everything early, avoid restructuring loans and check your credit report carefully for errors.\n\nIncorrect loan statuses or wrongly reported delays are not rare. Getting them fixed before applying can improve your negotiating position.\n\nWhy patience usually pays off\n\nAn 800-plus credit score does not guarantee the lowest possible home loan rate. But it puts you in the best possible position to ask for it.\n\nIronically, the behaviour that gets you there is not dramatic. It is steady, repetitive and sometimes dull. From a bank’s point of view, that is exactly the kind of borrower they are happy to lend to for decades.",
