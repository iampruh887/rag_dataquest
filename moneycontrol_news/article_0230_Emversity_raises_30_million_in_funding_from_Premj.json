  "content": "Emversity, a higher-education embedded training and employability platform, has raised $30 million (around Rs 271 crore) in a Series A funding round led by Premji Invest, with participation from existing investors Lightspeed and Z47.\n\nThe capital will be deployed towards scaling Emversity’s university partnerships, expanding into new skilling verticals, and deepening employer-aligned workforce pipelines across sectors facing skilled talent shortages.\n\nEmversity founder and CEO Vivek Sinha told Moneycontrol the company’s immediate focus is campus expansion and disciplined execution. \"We are currently present across more than 40 campuses, and this round gives us the ability to scale that model meaningfully while maintaining outcome consistency,\" he said.\n\nWhat does Emversity do?\n\nFounded in 2023, Emversity partners with higher-education institutions to embed industry-aligned curriculum, applied training, apprenticeships and placement support directly into degree programmes. At the same time, it works with employers to define job-ready skill requirements and co-create workforce pipelines.\n\nThe company also operates dedicated skill centres in affiliation with the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), allowing it to run both university-embedded programmes and short-term training tracks, particularly in healthcare and hospitality.\n\nSinha said the company’s approach starts with employer demand rather than student supply. \"We don't design programmes in isolation. We start with what employers need on day one and then work backwards with universities to embed that into existing academic structures,\" he said.\n\nWhy raise capital now?\n\nSinha said the Series A round was entirely inbound and not part of a planned fundraising process.\n\n\"We were sufficiently capitalised and had planned to go to the market in 2026, but the scale we reached and the institutional partnerships we built led to inbound interest,\" he said.\n\nThe company has not disclosed the valuation of the round.\n\nWhy did investors back Emversity?\n\nKaveesh Chawla, partner at Premji Invest, said the firm’s decision to lead the round was driven by Emversity’s focus on employability outcomes rather than credentials alone.\n\n\"Our investment in Emversity reflects our strong conviction in the role of outcome-oriented education and skilling in driving long-term social and economic impact in India,\" Chawla said. \"As the need to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world employability grows, Emversity’s student-centric approach, focus on apprenticeships, and strong alignment with industry partners position it well to address this gap at scale.\"\n\nRajat Agarwal, Managing Director at Z47, said the company is building critical employability infrastructure in sectors central to India’s growth. \"The team has demonstrated consistency and resilience in a complex operating environment, and this round supports the next phase of scaling a durable, employment-led higher education platform,\" he said, adding that Z47 was pleased to continue partnering with Emversity.\n\nHarsha Kumar, partner at Lightspeed, said Emversity’s decision to work within universities — rather than bypass them — sets it apart. \"Emversity is addressing a fundamental gap between education and employability in India by working within existing institutions rather than around them,\" he said. \"Vivek and the team have built a disciplined, outcomes-led platform that aligns universities, employers, and learners over the long term.\"\n\nScale so far and what’s next\n\nEmversity currently supports over 4,500 learners across more than 40 campuses in 23 states. Its employer partners include Fortis Healthcare, Apollo Hospitals, Aster, KIMS, IHCL (Taj Hotels) and Lemon Tree Hotels. The company employs around 700 people.\n\nEmversity last raised $5 million in its pre-Series A funding round in April last year, led by Lightspeed and Z47. The latest round takes its total funding to $46 million.\n\nLooking ahead, Sinha said the biggest challenge will be maintaining outcome consistency as the company scales. \"The thesis is already proven—there is demand from employers and students,\" he said. \"The real challenge is execution and discipline. If we can deliver the same quality of outcomes at scale, we build a great institution.\"",
