  "content": "The delay in inclusion of Indian bond in the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index is based on rules-based principles laid out by Bloomberg Index Services Ltd (BISL) and not discretion or market views.\n\nIn its Benchmark Procedures Handbook, BISL says that benchmarks are designed to be “representative of the market or asset class being measured”, “replicable”, and “objective and transparent, with clearly defined and objective rules”.\n\nOn January 13, BISL deferred the inclusion of Indian government securities in the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index citing the need for further evaluation of operational and market infrastructure aspects.\n\nBISL has kept the review open and ongoing while continuing to engage with index users, market participants, custodians, regulators and relevant authorities to better understand further efficiencies that could be made in market infrastructure and post-trade processes, a statement said.\n\nOn January 31, 2025, BISL added Indian bonds to its Bloomberg Emerging Market (EM) Local Currency Index. The inclusion took place in a phased manner over 0-month period starting January 31, 2025, which is when the index rebalancing took place.\n\nRules-based framework\n\nBloomberg says all benchmarks it administers are “rules-based with inclusion determined by transparent eligibility criteria”. This framework leaves limited scope for subjective judgment, meaning markets must meet the stated requirements on an ongoing basis to qualify for inclusion.\n\nReplicability a core requirement\n\nA central requirement is replicability. Benchmarks should be “replicable, offering a sufficiently sized universe without unnecessary turnover and transaction costs”.\n\nThis requirement reflects Bloomberg’s emphasis on ensuring that benchmarks can be tracked efficiently by users without operational or cost-related challenges.\n\nMarket size is big enough\n\nIndia’s government bond market is now over Rs 119 lakh crore outstanding securities, larger than several countries included in the index.\n\nBloomberg says benchmarks should offer “a sufficiently sized universe without unnecessary turnover and transaction costs”. On size alone, India meets this condition.\n\nLimited use of discretion\n\nBloomberg notes that benchmarks are generally produced without discretion in day-to-day calculation. The use of expert judgment is limited to “extraordinary circumstances (such as a fundamental shift in the economic or regulatory structure of the underlying market).” This implies a preference for markets where benchmark calculation does not require frequent intervention or adjustment.\n\nOperational continuity\n\nThe handbook says BISL may use expert judgment or discretion in certain limited circumstances, with regards to the extraordinary circumstances (such as a fundamental shift in the economic or regulatory structure of the underlying market), during a market emergency, a market disruption event, data disruption event and operational disruption event.\n\nThese provisions underscore Bloomberg’s focus on benchmarks that can be maintained consistently, without disruption across market conditions.\n\nBloomberg’s documentation indicates that inclusion in the Global Aggregate Bond Index is determined by alignment with its benchmark design principles rather than by the size of the economy, reform intent or discretionary assessment.\n\nTo qualify for inclusion, a market must consistently meet Bloomberg’s requirements for replicability, operational stability and transparency.",
