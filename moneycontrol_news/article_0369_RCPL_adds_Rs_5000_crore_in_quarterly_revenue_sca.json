  "content": "Reliance Consumer Products Ltd (RCPL), which became a direct subsidiary of Reliance Industries on December 1, added about Rs 5,000 crore in revenue during the quarter, taking its year-to-date revenue to Rs 15,000 crore, its chief operating officer Ketan Mody said.\n\nThe company is moving towards its near-term goal to reach Rs 1 lakh crore in five years, driven by volume in its mass-market brands such as Campa and expanding distribution through Reliance Retail's network.\n\nRCPL's beverages portfolio, which includes soft drink brand Campa, sports and energy drink brand Spinner,  fruit-based hydration and juice brand RasKik, continues to gain traction, Mody said, adding that the portfolio holds double-digit share in key markets. RCPL plans to more than double beverage capacity this year, supported by high-speed manufacturing lines across 12 states.\n\n“We continue our momentum for this quarter,” Mody said, adding that daily essentials grew 1.5 times year-on-year, while the company’s Independence brand has crossed Rs 1,500 crore in sales.\n\nThe company’s energy drinks business has reached Rs 1,000 crore in revenue for the year, he added.\n\nRCPL reported its financial performance separately for the first time, after being demerged from Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) last year.\n\nCommenting on the other units, Mody said RCPL saw growth across biscuits, confectionery, home and personal care, driven by new product launches and market expansion. He mentioned that four other brands in the portfolio have crossed the Rs 1,000-crore mark, without mentioning the names of the brands.\n\nRCPL flagged robust growth in the snacks business, spurred by expansion into new markets and increased demand for its value packs, while on the staples side, the company is seeing some traction in oil as a category.\n\n\"We have been allocated land across multiple states. Most of the sites are for food parks and will begin by the next quarter. In fact, one of the beverage plants at Kurnool will be ready by March itself,\" he said.\n\nLast month, the company acquired a majority stake in Tamil Nadu-based Udhaiyams Agro Foods, and it plans to become a significant player in pulses with the acquisition.\n\nFurther, RCPL has also forayed into the pet care category, Mody said, adding that it has piloted it in southern markets and plans to scale it up in the next couple of quarters.",
