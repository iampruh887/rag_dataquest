  "content": "For years, home loan interest rates were something borrowers set and forgot. You picked a lender, signed the papers, and assumed the rate would broadly take care of itself. That assumption turned out to be expensive.\n\nAs interest rates moved sharply over the last few years, a large number of borrowers discover they are paying far more than they need to. Not because rates went up, but because they are sitting on the wrong kind of rate structure and never question it.\n\nWhere things quietly go wrong\n\nThe biggest mistake isn’t taking a home loan when rates are low. That part makes sense. The problem is staying on rates that stop reflecting reality.\n\nMany borrowers remain on older base rate or MCLR-linkedloanslong after banks shift to external benchmark-linked rates. On paper, the difference looks small. In practice, it compounds month after month.\n\nOthers choose fixed-rate loans believing they are buying certainty. What they often bring instead is rigidity. When rates start falling or reset structures changed, fixed-rate borrowers find themselves locked into higher costs with limited exit options.\n\nWhy the impact feels invisible at first\n\nHome loans are long-term by design. A few thousand rupees extra every month doesn’t feel alarming when spread over decades. The EMI still gets paid. Life moves on.\n\nThe real cost shows up over time. Higher interest means slower principal repayment. That keeps the outstanding loan larger for longer, which in turn increases total interest paid over the life of the loan.\n\nBy the time many borrowers realise this, years have already passed.\n\nThe fixed versus floating misunderstanding\n\nFixed-rate loans are often sold as peace of mind. The pitch is simple. No surprises. Stable EMIs.\n\nWhat is less emphasised is how limited “fixed” often is. Many so-called fixed-rate home loans are only fixed for a short initial period. After that, they reset at rates that may no longer be competitive.\n\nFloating-rate borrowers face their own issues. Those on older benchmarks don’t see rate cuts flow through properly, while hikes are passed on quickly. The structure matters more than borrowers realise.\n\nWhy banks have little incentive to correct this for you\n\nBanks are not required to proactively move borrowers to cheaper benchmarks. If you don’t ask, nothing changes.\n\nFrom the bank’s perspective, an old loan paying a higher rate isn’t a problem. It becomes a problem only when the borrower pushes back, asks for a reset, or threatens to move.\n\nMany borrowers simply didn’t know they could do that.\n\nWhat you should check immediately\n\nThe first thing to look at is what your loan is linked to. If it’s not linked to an external benchmark like the repo rate, you may already be overpaying.\n\nThe second thing is your spread. Even among repo-linked loans, the spread over the benchmark varies. Two borrowers with the same bank and similar profiles can be paying different rates.\n\nFinally, look at how much of your EMI is going towards principal today compared to a few years ago. If progress feels painfully slow, interest is doing more damage than you think.\n\nWhat you can still do now\n\nThe most straightforward fix is a rate reset. Many banks allow borrowers to switch to a lower rate for a fee. It’s not pleasant to pay a fee, but it can be worth it if it lowers your rate meaningfully.\n\nAnother option is refinancing. Moving the loan to another lender can reset the rate structure entirely. This takes effort and paperwork, but for large outstanding balances, the savings can be substantial.\n\nPrepayments also matter more than people realise. Even small, regular prepayments directly reduce the principal and cut interest outgo over the long term.\n\nThe bigger lesson borrowers are learning late\n\nHome loans reward attention, not loyalty. The best rate is rarely permanent. It has to be defended.\n\nBorrowers who reviewed their loans periodically, questioned rate changes, and acted when needed paid far less over time. Those who assumed things would adjust automatically ended up subsidising that comfort.\n\nThe mistake wasn’t choosing a home loan. It was choosing it once and never choosing again.",
