Of these, the BJP secured 93 seats, while the Shinde-led Shiv Sena won 27.\n\nThanking the people, PM Modi wrote, “the dynamic people of the state bless the NDA’s agenda of pro-people good governance.”\n\nMNS's throwback rhetoric to the Shiv Sena’s early years, including slogans like 'hatao lungi, bajao pungi', did not woo voters, particularly in cosmopolitan centres such as Mumbai and Pune.\n\nIn a post on X, Amit Shah said the verdict reflected people’s confidence in governance focused on welfare and growth, and thanked voters across the state for their backing.\n\nAfter initially enjoying the backing of Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray, a rift in the mid-1990s prompted Gawli to form his own political outfit.\n\nUddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena (UBT) outperformed the Eknath Shinde faction in the BMC election, but failed to win the prestigious BMC election\n\nThe victory in the BMC polls has allowed Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to consolidated his position as the state’s most powerful political figure, even as the Thackerays suffer their biggest civic setback in decades.\n\nWhile the UBT is no longer the city’s dominant political force, its ability to stay in contention against a formidable combination of the BJP and the Shinde-led Sena represents a notable political achievement for Uddhav.\n\nThe result of the prestigious civic body election will have wider ramifications on the politics of Maharashtra, where BJP has steadly marked its dominance.\n\nVoting for the 227-member civic body, India's largest and richest, concluded on Thursday amid tight security.\n\nHere is the complete list results of all 29 municipal corporations in Maharashtra:\n\nAccording to data released by the civic body, ward number 114 in suburban Bhandup recorded the highest turnout at 64.53 per cent, while ward number 227 in south Mumbai’s Colaba area reported the lowest turnout at 20.88 per cent.\n\nGet the latest Pune PMC Election 2026 results, live vote counting trends and the full list of winning candidates here.\n\nMaharashtra BMC Elections Result live:Visuals from Shiv Sena Bhavan in Mumbai showed party workers celebrating as trends  indicated the BJP–Shiv Sena-led Mahayuti pulling ahead.\n\nAsked about the comments made by the jathedar last week on certain videos circulating on social media, Mann claimed they were fake or AI-generated, which “could be verified in any forensic lab”.\n\nSensex TodayBharat Coking Coal Share PriceMumbai BMC Election ResultsMaharashtra Election ResultsInfosys Share PricePune Election ResultsOld Tax RegimeNobel Peace Prize medalGold PriceAmazon Great Republic Day Sale\n\nBusinessMarketsStocksIndia NewsCity NewsEconomyMutual FundsPersonal FinanceIPO NewsStartups\n\nHomeCurrenciesCommoditiesPre-MarketIPOGlobal MarketBonds\n\nHomeLoans up to 50 LakhsCredit Cards Lifetime FreeFinance TrackerNewFixed DepositsFixed Deposit ComparisonFixed Income\n\nHomeMC 30Top Ranked FundsETFsMutual Fund Screener\n\nIncome Tax CalculatorEMI CalculatorRetirement PlanningGratuity CalculatorPetrol Price in IndiaDiesel Price in IndiaIFSC Code\n\nNews18FirstpostCNBC TV18News18 HindiCricketnextOverdrive\n\nAbout UsContact UsAdvisory AlertAdvertise with UsSupportDisclaimerPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyTerms & ConditionsFinancial Terms (Glossary)SitemapInvestors\n\nCopyright © Network18 Media & Investments Limited.
