  "content": "The US control of Venezuelan oil assets following the capture of President Nicolás Maduro may offer Indian pharmaceutical companies exporting medicines to the Latin American country a path to recover millions in stalled payments and revive a once-lucrative export market.\n\nWhile the military and political upheaval in Caracas has frozen global energy flows, the prospect of US oversight of Venezuela’s oil wealth could resolve the \"dollar crunch\" that has long plagued Indian exporters.\n\n\"The recent US move signals a strategic shift that carries potential upside for exporters like Indian pharmaceutical firms,\" said a pharmaceutical executive who didn’t want to be named. “These are early days; any boost to oil trade will also impact healthcare spending.”\n\nVenezuela was once a major growth market for Indian pharmaceutical companies, withDr Reddy’sranking it as its fourth-largest export market in FY15, contributing $136 million to sales. At its peak, India pharma exports to Venezuela touched $250 million before the country’s economic collapse.\n\nThe downturn triggered severe losses — Dr Reddy’s alone faced a Rs.508.5 crore ($75–77 million) hit in FY16 due to receivable write-downs, including a single quarterly impact of Rs 430.9 crore ($65 million). After recovering only $4 million of its outstanding balance, the company dissolved its Venezuelan subsidiary in June 2024, making a complete exit form the Latin American nation.\n\nIn FY25, total exports to Venezuela are estimated at Rs. 900 crore ($107 million), which is less than 0.5 per cent of India’s global pharmaceutical exports. Most Indian companies are limited to supplying essential medicines on humanitarian grounds and also operate a cash-and-carry model.Sun PharmaandCiplaare other companies with export presence in Venezuelan market.\n\nVenezuela's 2024 pharmaceutical market paints a complex picture, with significant import growth. The country imported up to $538 million in 2024 from $365 million in 2023, driven by generics. China and Brazil are major suppliers, with Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMOs) playing a vital role in local service provision, according to an Amber Lifesciences and a Scribd report. The imports surged 23.4 percent in the first half of 2025.\n\nWith a population of around three crore, Venezuela is the fifth largest country in South America but given the economic turmoil, it remains a small market. To put it in perspective,  Peru, with a slightly higher population, has a pharmaceutical market five times the size of Venezuela.\n\nIndian firms scaled back or exited due to hyperinflation, currency devaluation, and payment risks that made repatriation of profits nearly impossible. US sanctions and political instability further complicated trade and raised concerns over asset recovery and contract enforcement, turning what was once a promising market into an untenable business environment.\n\nBut with changed circumstances, US control of oil revenues could provide the stable dollar funding needed to guarantee payments for life-saving generics and biologics.\n\nWhile Indian pharma firms have scaled back due to extreme economic instability and payment risks, a US-led restructuring of the Venezuelan oil sector could allow for the repatriation of massive unpaid dividends and a return to humanitarian roles in the region.",
