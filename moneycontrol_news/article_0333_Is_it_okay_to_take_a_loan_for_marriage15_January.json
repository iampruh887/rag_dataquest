Expenses can easily turn into a hefty amount, placing a huge financial burden on families.\n\nAs a result, many look for a loan for marriage to cover the soaring expenses. But this raises an important question: is it wise to opt for a marriage loan in India?\n\nA marriage loan, also known as a wedding loan, is a type of personal loan designed to help people finance wedding-related expenses. As it is an unsecured loan, you don't have to offer any collateral.\n\nThe marriage loan can be used for various purposes such as venue booking, buying jewellery and clothes, hiring makeup artists and photographers, or arranging decor.\n\nMoneycontrol has teamed up with 8 trusted lenders to offerpersonal loans of up to Rs 50 lakh.

Interest rates start from 10.50% per annum.\n\nIs it okay to take a loan for marriage?\n\nThere is no harm in taking a loan for marriage as long as you have a stable financial condition and the ability to repay it on time. A steady income is crucial to ensure timely EMI payments, which in turn can also help in a good credit score.\n\nIt is also wiser to opt for a marriage loan instead of dipping into emergency funds or retirement funds, just for a one-time celebration, as borrowing a large amount of loan just to host an exquisite wedding can backfire.\n\nHowever, you need to make a decision cautiously if you already have existing loans or limited repayment capacity. This can lead to another financial obligation and can stretch your budget, leading to long-term stress.\n\nInterest rates for marriage loans\n\nSeveral banks provide loans for marriage and each bank has its own set of interest rates and repayment tenure.\n\n1.HDFC Bank:You can get a loan anywhere between Rs 50,000 and Rs 40 lakh with a flexible repayment tenure of 1 to 5 years.
