In an interview with CNBC TV18, Sikka -- former CEO of Infosys -- warned of a hype cycle, noting that the economics of the massive spending on AI infrastructure are not currently supported by revenues.\n\nSikka explained the discrepancy by breaking down the numbers. He pointed out that while a company like Nvidia generates approximately $250 billion annually from its GPU sales, the total ecosystem spending, including CPUs, memory, and networking, swells this figure to about $750-$800 billion a year. To justify this expenditure over a four-year amortisation period, the industry would need to generate around $200 billion in new revenue. \"Where is the 200 billion? There is no 200 billion. OpenAI's revenue is 15 billion, something like that. And so there is a huge gap,\" Sikka stated. He questioned how long this gap would be funded, acknowledging that while one could call it a bubble, the current reality is that the economics \"don't add up to what has been spent.\"\n\nAddressing the impact on India's information technology services sector, Sikka asserted that AI is already capable of effectively automating well-defined, structured activities such as software development, maintenance, and business process execution. This means a much smaller team equipped with AI can perform the work previously done by a larger group. He urged Indian IT companies to embrace this transformation, even if it leads to lower short-term economic gains. The key to navigating this shift, he advised, is for these firms to become software companies in addition to being services companies. \"It has to be your own software,\" he emphasized. By developing proprietary AI platforms, IT firms can retain value even as the number of billable hours for projects decreases. This necessitates a business model adjustment away from purely people-based pricing towards fixed-fee, outcome-based approaches that account for the value of the software itself.\n\nLooking at India's position in the global AI race, Sikka expressed strong optimism, citing the nation's \"demographic dividend.\" He described AI as a powerful tool, much like others invented throughout human history, that can empower India's large, young, and educated population. \"The great mandate for us is how do we make all our people able to use these tools to build amazing things for themselves, for our country, but also for the world,\" he said. Sikka believes that if India can successfully equip its billion-strong population to use AI effectively, the country will thrive.\n\nFurthermore, Sikka called for greater participation in building foundational AI technologies within India. Dismissing the notion that the country has missed its opportunity, he compared the current stage of AI development to being in the \"first over of a T20 match.\" He expressed a desire to see a great foundation model built in India and highlighted immense opportunities for innovation. Future advancements, according to Sikka, lie in creating vertical foundation models for specific industries like healthcare, models trained on India's diverse local languages, and sophisticated \"world models\" that can understand the physical world and activities specific to the Indian context, such as traffic patterns and infrastructure.",
