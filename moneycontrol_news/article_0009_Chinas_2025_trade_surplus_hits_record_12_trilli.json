  "content": "China’s trade surplus climbed to $1.2 trillion in 2025, extending a record run as the tariff war started by President Donald Trump sent exporters in search of markets beyond the US.\n\nShipments to regions like Southeast Asia and Europe made up for a deepening plunge in sales to the US in December, with overall exports increasing 6.6% from a year earlier. That was the quickest growth in three months and faster than any forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists, whose median was for a 3.1% gain.\n\nImports also rose more than expected with a jump of 5.7%, leaving a surplus of $114 billion — the most in six months, according to data from China’s General Administration of Customs on Wednesday. The US share of China’s total exports fell to a historic low of 11% in 2025, according to Bloomberg Economics, a drop of eight percentage points since Trump’s first term.\n\nShipments overseas have boomed through much of the trade war and after the recent de-escalation of tensions with the Trump administration. But as China navigates tariffs and growing economic protectionism around the world, it’s stirring anxiety abroad as it pours exports into Africa, Latin America and beyond.\n\nThe swelling surplus also underscores the imbalance between China’s manufacturing strength and stubbornly weak domestic consumption. While exports have powered the world’s second-biggest economy, its years-long property slump and falling investment are restraining the country’s appetite for foreign goods.\n\nDespite a global backlash, Chinese companies aggressively sought out customers in other markets when shipments to the US plunged after Trump hiked tariffs. Exports to the US slumped more than 30% in December, among their worst declines this year.\n\nFor the full year of 2025, exports to Africa saw the fastest growth among major regions with a 26% gain from a year ago. Shipments to the Southeast Asian nations in the Asean group expanded 13%, and those to the European Union and Latin America rose 8% and 7% respectively. Exports to the US plunged 20%.\n\nLooking ahead, global demand for China’s goods and the competitiveness of its exports will likely keep foreign shipments on the rise in 2026, especially if the trade ceasefire with the US holds.\n\nThis week, Trump announced new tariffs on goods from countries trading with Iran, threatening to derail his one-year truce with China, the world’s top buyer of Iranian oil.\n\nOther risks abound. Tensions over the influx of goods are building with major partners such as Europe. And a high base of comparison last year means export growth will probably moderate in the months ahead.\n\n“The external environment for China’s trade development is still grim and complex” in 2026 due to slower global economic growth and geopolitical fragmentation, Wang Jun, deputy head of the customs authority, said during a briefing in Beijing Wednesday. But “with more diversified trading partners and strengthened resilience, the fundamentals of China’s trade remain solid,” he said.\n\nThe Chinese government has also moved to rein in the exports of some goods to ease trade tensions and as part of an effort to address excess capacity in several industries that’s adding deflationary pressure on the economy.\n\nAuthorities will cancel the export tax rebates on hundreds of products including solar cells and batteries from April, according to an official announcement on Friday.\n\nExports of higher-value goods surged in 2025, with products including semiconductors, cars and ships recording gains of more than 20% from a year ago. Meanwhile, some lower-end exports such as toys, shoes and clothing contracted.\n\nLynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Groep NV, warned China is facing “some pushback” as its higher-end products become more competitive globally.\n\n“The key to continuing win-win cooperation is to boost China’s domestic demand and support imports,” he said. Overall, the stronger-than-forecast figures are “an encouraging sign for China as well as trading partners, given we were looking at a potential deceleration due to last year’s frontloading effect.”",
