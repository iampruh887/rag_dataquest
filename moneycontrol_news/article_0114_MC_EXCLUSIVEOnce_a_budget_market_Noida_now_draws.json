  "content": "Noida, once known for offering affordable housing for the salaried middle class in the National Capital Region (NCR), is now becoming a hub for high-end residential developments, including branded residences by top hospitality, lifestyle and luxury brands.\n\nDriven by expanding job opportunities, infrastructure growth, rising wealth, and evolving buyer aspirations, the city is swiftly developing into a luxury and branded-residence destination, attracting high-net-worth individuals (HNIs), non-resident Indians (NRIs) and entrepreneurial buyers who once focused primarily on Mumbai, Delhi and Gurugram.\n\nBranded residences take centre stage\n\nNoida has seen a string of branded residences by Gulshan Group, M3M India and Smartworld Developers. In October 2025, M3M India collaborated with global luxury jewellery and watches brand Jacob & Co. to launch M3M-Jacob & Co Residences.\n\nSimilarly, in December, the Indian Hotels Company Ltd (IHCL), the owner of Taj Hotels, has collaborated with Noida-based realty firm Gulshan Group to develop a Taj hotel and Taj Branded Serviced Apartments in Noida’s Sector 129 along the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway.\n\nAlso Read: From Trump Towers to Jacob & Co, branded residences lead India’s luxury housing wave\n\nJoining the league of branded residences, Smartworld Developers has collaborated with Lebanon-based fashion designer and lifestyle brand, Elie Saab, for another branded residence project in Sector 98 in Noida. Besides these, M3M India is also planning to launch Trump-branded residences in Noida.\n\nThe apartments in these branded residences in Noida typically range from Rs 9 crore to Rs 25 crore, depending on their size, location, and the brand.\n\nMarket observers said that these high-end property launches mark a departure from Noida’s traditional product mix, where housing was largely driven by mid-income segments. Developers are now focusing on differentiated offerings tailored to luxury, lifestyle and brand-conscious buyers.\n\nDevelopers and market analysts said that the primary buyers of Noida’s luxury and branded residences include HNIs, NRIs, corporates, entrepreneurs from tier-1 and 2 cities, and some celebrities.\n\nYukti Nagpal, Director, Gulshan Group, said that buyers of high-end apartments are CXO-level professionals, entrepreneurs, and NRIs seeking space, comfort, and long-term value.\n\n“Compared to Mumbai, Delhi, or Gurugram, Noida still offers larger homes and better value, which is increasingly influencing premium homebuyer decisions,” she said.\n\nPankaj Bansal, the owner of M3M India and founder of Smartworld Developers, said buyers are largely people who have arrived in their lives and want their presence to be felt.\n\n“Either these people have a lot of money, or they are famous in the area they operate. The second category is the wealthy people who want to move from tier-2 cities to tier-1 cities. They want their second generation to live in tier-1 cities. The third ones are the CEOs and CFOs of large multinational companies,” he said.\n\nVishal Raheja, Founder and Managing Director, InvestoXpert Advisors, said that investment motivation plays an equally strong role in the purchase of such properties.\n\n\"NRIs and strategic investors are also actively acquiring premium residences driven by strong capital appreciation potential, attractive rental yields in prime business corridors, and limited high-quality inventory that ensures sustained resale value,” he said.\n\nRaheja added that an emerging segment of younger, affluent professionals and dual-income households in tech, finance, and services also prefer to buy branded properties as they seek exclusivity, security, wellness and globally benchmarked amenities.\n\nKey factors driving growth of luxury or branded residences\n\nAshish Narain Agarwal, the founder and Managing Director of PropertyPistol, a real estate consultant, said that infrastructure development, strategic urban planning, expanding expressways, metro connectivity, and proximity to the upcoming Noida International Airport are fueling Noida’s transformation.\n\nAlso Read: M3M–Jacob & Co branded 5BHK residences sell out at Rs 40,000 per sq ft in Noida — highest-ever rate for the city\n\nStrong corporate growth driven by IT parks, industrial corridors, and global capability centres (GCC) has created a high-income working population seeking premium lifestyle housing.\n\n“Alongside this, growing demand for modern amenities, wellness-led environments, security, and branded living experiences has encouraged developers to introduce world-class luxury offerings. As a result, Noida is evolving from a functional residential zone into a sophisticated luxury destination offering global-standard living, lifestyle convenience, and strong investment prospects,” he said.\n\nRavi Nirwal, Principal Partner and Sales Director, Square Yards, said that the availability of large, contiguous land parcels in Noida has allowed developers to plan integrated, low-density projects with premium amenities, which is often difficult in more saturated markets.\n\nComparison of Noida with Mumbai, Delhi, and Gurugram\n\nRaheja of InvestoXperts said that Noida today stands out as one of India’s most competitive premium real estate destinations, offering a balance of affordability, lifestyle excellence, and future-ready infrastructure.\n\nAccording to data from InvestoXpert, property prices in Noida typically range between Rs 9,000 – Rs 15,000 per sqft, with ultra-luxury developments oscillating between Rs 15,000 – Rs 40,000 per sq ft, compared with Delhi-NCR’s regional luxury average of Rs 23,000 per sq ft.\n\nAverage pricing in Gurugram ranges between Rs 20,000 and Rs 37,000 per sq ft in premium corridors, while Mumbai’s average pricing is significantly higher, from Rs 40,000 per sq ft to over Rs 100,000 in marquee micro-markets.\n\nUnlike Mumbai, where ultra luxury is often defined by scarcity and location, or central Delhi, where legacy and exclusivity play a major role, Noida’s premium offerings are more focused on scale, modern infrastructure and planned development, said Nirwal of Square Yards.\n\n“When compared to Gurugram, which has a more mature luxury ecosystem and proximity to corporate headquarters, Noida is emerging as an alternative for buyers prioritising newer infrastructure and comparatively competitive pricing,” he said.",
