(+6.0% QoQ /+13.3% YoY), ahead of our estimates (+2.4%), driven by steady demand across core services, supported by improved execution momentum and continued traction in large transformation and engineering-led programs. USD Revenue stood at 3,793 Mn. (4.2% QoQ CC/ +4.8% YoY CC), performed better than our expectations. EBIT rose 13.2% QoQ and 8.0% YoY to INR 62,850 Mn, with EBIT margin +118 bps QoQ to 18.6%, reflecting cost pressures and incremental investments, partly offset by revenue scale benefits. Net profit stood at INR 40,760 Mn, declining 3.8% QoQ and 11.2% YoY, impacted by higher finance costs, exceptional items amounting to INR 9,560 Mn. Consequently, net margin contracted 122 bps QoQ to 12.0%.\n\nWe estimate revenue/earnings CAGR of 3.6%/5.9% over FY25-FY27E. We value HCL Tech at a P/E multiple of 22x to Dec’27 EPS. At current levels, the stock trades at a premium to its long-term average, factoring in strong execution, sustained deal momentum, and leadership in AI-led transformation. Accordingly, We downgrade our “ACCUMULATE” rating to “HOLD” on the stock.\n\nFor all recommendations report,click here\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
