This is a stark contrast to the same months in 2024 and 2023, when prices in these categories barely moved, falling by just 0.3 percent on average. The data suggests that where tax cuts were deep and demand is relatively elastic, firms moved quickly to pass on the benefit to consumers.\n\nThe sharpest declines were concentrated in categories where GST rates were cut the most. Items mapped to an average GST reduction of about 7.8 percent saw prices fall 3.6 percent in 2025. In comparison, the same set of items recorded a marginal increase of 0.2 percent in 2024 and a 0.4 percent rise in 2023, underscoring how unusual the latest price adjustment has been.\n\nAutomobiles stand out most clearly. Prices of motor cars dropped 7.3 percent between September and December, while motorcycles and scooters became 4.6 percent cheaper. These are categories where GST cuts were substantial, and competition is intense, making it easier for manufacturers and dealers to reflect tax changes quickly in showroom prices.\n\nHousehold durables also saw meaningful relief. Washing machines recorded a 4.2 percent fall in prices over the three months, air-conditioners and air coolers declined 3.0 percent, televisions fell by a similar margin, and refrigerators became about 2.2 percent cheaper. Together, these moves suggest that GST changes are filtering through fastest in durable goods that involve larger, infrequent purchases and clearer price tags.\n\nThe picture is very different for everyday consumables. Even where GST rates were slashed sharply—such as edible items moved to the 5 percent slab from 18 percent—the pass-through has been limited. Candy prices declined just 1.8 percent over the period, while biscuits and chocolates saw a modest 1.2 percent drop.\n\nA similar pattern is visible in categories shifted from the 12 percent slab to 5 percent. Products such as coffee, bicycles, toilet soap, toothpaste and other toiletries recorded only small declines. On average, across 51 CPI items affected by GST changes, prices edged down by just 0.11 percent between September and December 2025. That compares with a 1 percent rise over the same months in 2024 and a 0.33 percent increase in 2023.\n\nEven within this group, the relief has been uneven. Toilet soap prices fell 1.5 percent, while toothpaste became only 0.33 percent cheaper over three months, indicating that firms in fast-moving consumer goods may be absorbing part of the tax cut through margins rather than fully passing it on.\n\nBy contrast, items where GST rates were left unchanged showed little deviation from past trends. These categories saw prices rise 0.67 percent between September and December 2025, broadly in line with the roughly 0.6 percent increase recorded over the same period in the previous two years.",
