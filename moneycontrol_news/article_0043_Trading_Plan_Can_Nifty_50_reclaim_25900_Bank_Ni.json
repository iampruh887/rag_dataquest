  "content": "The sharp recovery from the dayâ€™s low, coupled with a bullish reversal pattern (piercing line) formation after a five-day correction, has raised hopes of a further rally in the Nifty 50, though the India VIX appears to be continuing its rise towards the 12 zone. If the index extends its gains, the 25,900â€“26,000 levels will be crucial to watch in the upcoming sessions. However, immediate support is placed at 25,700. Meanwhile, the Bank Nifty is expected to face an immediate hurdle at 59,700, as sustaining above this level could open the door for a move beyond the 60,000 zone. On the downside, the 59,200â€“59,000 range is likely to act as immediate support, followed by 58,700 as a key support zone, experts said.\n\nOn January 12, the Nifty 50 rose 107 points (0.42 percent) to 25,790, while the Bank Nifty climbed 199 points (0.34 percent) to 59,451. However, market breadth remained favourable for bears, with about 1,866 shares declining against 1,044 advancing shares on the NSE.\n\nNifty Outlook and Strategy\n\nJay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities\n\nThe Nifty 50 recovered quite sharply from its dayâ€™s low and managed to close well above the 25,700 level, which was a critical support of the last series. A close above 25,700 indicates that a short-term bottom is in place, as long as the 25,450 level is held.\n\nIndia VIX closed 4.05 percent higher at 11.37, which has moved up as anticipated and reached near its short-term target of 12. From here on, the VIX is likely to see some further upside at least until Budget Day and may test the 13 level on the upside. However, it is unlikely to fall below 10, so going forward, some more volatility in the markets cannot be ruled out.\n\nAs per the options data for this series, the 26,000 level is the key level to watch. Until the Nifty closes above it, the short-term range for the index is likely to remain between 26,000 and 25,500. Hence, a buy-on-dips and sell-on-rallies strategy is advisable until there is a breakout or breakdown from this range.\n\nKey Resistance: 26,000, 26,100\n\nKey Support: 25,600, 25,450\n\nStrategy: Buy Nifty Futures on dips in the range of 25,650-25,700, with a stop-loss below 25,450, for target of 26,000 and 26,100.\n\nJigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi\n\nIn the most recent trading session, the Nifty staged a sharp recovery from the dayâ€™s low, rebounding over 300 points and settling just below the 25,800 mark. Technically, the index found strong support in the 25,450â€“25,500 zone, which coincides with a previous demand area from November 2025 and the flat Ichimoku cloud, reinforcing its importance as a support base.\n\nOn the 30-minute chart, the DMI has indicated a positive crossover, while the RSI has moved above the 50 level, signalling improving momentum and the likelihood of continued recovery in the coming sessions.\n\nAdditionally, the Nifty Putâ€“Call Ratio (PCR) stands at 0.88 after plunging to 0.50 intraday, reflecting a more balanced and comfortable market positioning. Overall, these supportive technical indicators point towards a resumption of bullish momentum in the near term.\n\nKey Resistance: 25,900, 26,000\n\nKey Support: 25,500, 25,400\n\nStrategy: Buy Nifty Futures in the 25,800â€“25,700 zone, with a stop-loss of 25,550, targeting 26,200.\n\nShitij Gandhi, AVP - Technical Equity Research at SMC Global Securities\n\nMarket sentiment improved after encouraging remarks on a potential trade deal by the US Ambassador. Technically, the rebound has helped the Nifty reclaim short-term supports, indicating that selling pressure may be easing. The index is now expected to consolidate with a positive bias as long as it holds above the key support zone of 25,500â€“25,400.\n\nOn the upside, the 25,900â€“26,000 band remains an immediate resistance zone where supply is likely to emerge. A sustained move above this zone could open the door for a gradual up-move towards 26,200, while failure to hold supports may lead to renewed range-bound activity.\n\nKey Resistance: 25,900, 26,000\n\nKey Support: 25,600, 25,400\n\nStrategy: Buy Nifty Futures on dips near 25,750, with a stop-loss below 25,500, targeting 26,150.\n\nBank Nifty - Outlook and Positioning\n\nJay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities\n\nThe Bank Nifty also recovered sharply from lower levels and managed to close above 59,000, a level it has been holding since the December series. Hence, the 59,000 level on a closing basis is a key support, and unless it closes below this level for two consecutive days, the short-term range is likely to remain between 59,000 and 60,000.\n\nThere was significant Call unwinding and Put additions in the last trading session, indicating that short-term support is now at the 59,000 level. As long as this level is held, the Bank Nifty is likely to trade sideways to positive.\n\nKey Resistance: 59,700, 60,000\n\nKey Support: 59,200, 59,000\n\nStrategy: Buy Bank Nifty Futures on dips near 59,300, with a stop-loss of 58,900, targeting 59,700 and 60,000.\n\nJigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi\n\nIn the latest trading session, the Bank Nifty witnessed a sharp recovery from the dayâ€™s low, rebounding over 600 points and settling near the 59,450 mark. Technically, the index found strong support in the 58,800â€“58,900 zone, which coincides with a previous demand area from December 2025, the Ichimoku cloud, the 50 DEMA, and weekly pivot support, making this zone a crucial base for the ongoing recovery.\n\nOn the 30-minute chart, the DMI has shown a positive crossover, while the RSI has moved above the 50 level, indicating strengthening momentum and the possibility of further upside in the coming sessions. Additionally, the Bank Nifty Putâ€“Call Ratio (PCR) stands at 0.90 after dipping to 0.80 intraday, suggesting a more balanced market positioning. Overall, these supportive technical signals point towards a continuation of bullish momentum in the near term.\n\nKey Resistance: 59,700, 60,000\n\nKey Support: 58,900, 58,700\n\nStrategy: Buy Bank Nifty Futures in the 59,600â€“59,500 zone, with a stop-loss of 59,100, targeting 60,300.\n\nShitij Gandhi, AVP - Technical Equity Research at SMC Global Securities\n\nIn line with the Nifty, the Bank Nifty index also recovered from its intraday lows, supported by selective buying in banking stocks amid improved global cues. From a technical standpoint, this pullback has enabled the index to decisively reclaim its 35-day exponential moving average on the daily chart, thereby keeping the broader trend constructive.\n\nThe Bank Nifty is likely to maintain a mildly positive bias as long as it sustains above the 59,000â€“58,800 support zone. On the upside, immediate resistance is seen in the 59,800â€“60,000 range, followed by a stronger supply area near 60,200. A sustained breakout above these levels could revive bullish momentum, while a breach of key supports may lead to continued consolidation within a defined range.\n\nKey Resistance: 59,900, 60,100\n\nKey Support: 59,400, 59,200\n\nStrategy: Buy Bank Nifty Futures on dips near 59,400, with a stop-loss below 59,100, targeting 59,900.",
