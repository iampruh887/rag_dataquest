  "content": "Major quick commerce companies have dropped the \"10-minute delivery\" claim following the intervention of Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya over concerns related to the safety of delivery partners, multiple media reports said on Tuesday.\n\nThe move comes after Mandaviya held discussions with officials from Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy and Zomato, during which he urged the companies to eliminate rigid delivery time promises in the interest of protecting delivery workers.\n\nDuring the meetings, the minister emphasised that aggressive delivery timelines could put undue pressure on riders and compromise their safety, the reports added.\n\nAccording to the reports, the companies assured the government that they would remove delivery-time commitments from their advertisements, branding material and social media platforms, signalling a shift in how quick-commerce services are marketed.\n\nSwiggy, Zepto, Eternal didn’t respond toMoneycontrol’s request for comments\n\nThe Centre's intervention follows a strike by gig workers on December 31, 2025, when delivery partners across platforms raised concerns over low pay, unsafe working conditions and the pressure created by strict delivery timelines. Riders had warned that aggressive time-bound delivery models were pushing them to take risks on the road to meet targets.\n\nThe quick-commerce and food delivery market has expanded rapidly, with companies commanding large valuations. Swiggy is valued at around $11 billion, while rival Zomato has a market capitalisation of nearly $28 billion, underscoring the scale and influence of the sector.\n\nSeveral platforms, including Swiggy's Instamart, Blinkit and Zepto, have built their branding around ultra-fast deliveries, particularly the 10-minute promise. However, delivery workers have argued that such marketing strategies often translate into intense pressure on the ground, affecting both safety and overall well-being.\n\nRegulatory oversight of the gig economy has also gathered momentum at the state level. Rajasthan became the first state in 2023 to enact a law governing gig work, setting up a welfare board, creating a social security fund and establishing mechanisms to address worker grievances.\n\nMore recently, Karnataka-home to India's technology hub Bengaluru-and Jharkhand have passed similar legislation, while Telangana is examining the possibility of introducing its own framework.\n\nDespite the challenges, the gig economy has played a role in expanding workforce participation, particularly among women. In response to growing public scrutiny, several platforms have rolled out benefits such as accident cover and basic health insurance to offer some degree of social protection to delivery partners.",
