  "content": "Electric vehicle loans are often advertised as cheaper than standard car loans. Lower interest rates, special green financing, priority processing. On the surface, it sounds like an easy win for buyers considering the switch to electric.\n\nIn reality, EV loan pricing isn’t automatically low. It depends on two specific factors, and missing either of them can wipe out the advantage very quickly.\n\nThe first factor is who is subsidising the loan\n\nThe biggest reason some EVloanslook cheap is not generosity from banks. It’s subsidies, either direct or indirect.\n\nIn many cases, manufacturers absorb part of the interest cost to push adoption. Sometimes state-backed institutions or public sector banks offer concessional rates as part of broader clean-energy goals. In a few cases, the benefit comes from priority sector-style incentives or green financing pools.\n\nThis means the same borrower can see very different EV loan rates depending on the lender and the vehicle brand. If there’s no subsidy in play, the rate difference between an EV loan and a regular car loan often shrinks sharply.\n\nThe headline rate only stays low as long as someone else is helping pay for it.\n\nThe second factor is how lenders see risk and resale\n\nBanks price loans based on risk, not ideology. For EVs, two risks matter most: battery life and resale value.\n\nIf the lender is confident that the battery warranty is long, replacement costs are predictable, and resale demand is stable, they’re more comfortable offering better rates. This is why EV loans for established models from large manufacturers are often cheaper than loans for newer or niche models.\n\nWhere uncertainty is higher, interest rates creep up. Some lenders quietly offset perceived risk by shortening tenure, increasing margins, or tightening eligibility, even if the product is labelled an “EV loan”.\n\nCheap rates are usually tied to confidence in the asset, not just enthusiasm for electric mobility.\n\nWhy tenure and structure matter more than people think\n\nEven when EV loan rates are lower, the structure of the loan matters. Shorter tenures can make EMIs feel higher despite a lower rate. Balloon payments or step-up EMIs can look attractive upfront but change the real cost over time.\n\nThere’s also the question of whether the loan covers only the vehicle or includes charging equipment and accessories. Not all lenders treat these the same way, and that affects pricing.\n\nA loan that looks cheap on paper can become less so once these details are factored in.\n\nHow EV loans compare to regular car loans in practice\n\nFor borrowers with strong credit profiles, EV loans can be cheaper than standard car loans by a noticeable margin, especially when manufacturer tie-ups are involved.\n\nFor others, the difference may be marginal. In some cases, it disappears entirely once processing fees, insurance bundling, or shorter tenures are considered.\n\nThis is why comparing only interest rates is misleading. The effective cost depends on the full package, not just the number in the ad.\n\nWhen EV loans actually deliver savings\n\nEV loans make the most sense when three things line up. The lender is offering a subsidised or incentive-backed rate, the vehicle is from a manufacturer with strong resale confidence, and the borrower has a solid credit profile.\n\nWhen these conditions are met, borrowing costs can be meaningfully lower than those for petrol or diesel cars. Over the life of the loan, that difference adds up.\n\nWhen they don’t, the EV loan may still be competitive, but it’s not automatically a bargain.\n\nThe bigger takeaway for buyers\n\nThe real question isn’t whether EV loans are cheap. It’s why they’re cheap.\n\nUnderstanding who is absorbing the cost and how the lender views the vehicle helps buyers make better decisions. A low rate with hidden trade-offs is not always better than a slightly higher rate with flexibility and clarity.\n\nEV loans can be an advantage. They just aren’t one by default.",
