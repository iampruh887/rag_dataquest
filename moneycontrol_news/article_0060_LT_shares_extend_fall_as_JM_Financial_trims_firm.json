  "content": "JM Financial issued a cautious note forLarsen & Toubro(L&T), stating that the uncertainty around Kuwait reportedly cancelling a few tenders can cloud order inflow visibility for the engineering major.\n\nThe shares of the company extended decline for the fifth consecutive session on January 14.\n\nKuwait mulls cancellation of oil project tenders worth $8.7 bn, says report:\n\nKuwait is discussingplans to cancel oil project tenders worth $8.7 billion, media company MEED reported citing people familiar with the matter. It added that Kuwait's discussions come after bids for several contracts came in well above the budget, raising concerns over cost efficiency and fiscal impact.\n\nAccording to analysts quoted by CNBC-TV18, L&T was the lowest bidder in tenders worth more than $4.5 billion.\n\nMoneycontrolcouldn't independently verify the report.\n\nThe companyclarified that the said that the projectsreferred to in the media reports were not part of the company’s order book. \"Further, the Company can’t comment on the status of tenders or commercial decisions of its Clients,\" it added.\n\nIn its note, JM Financial said it has noted earlier that L&T is well-placed in $5-billion worth of tenders in Kuwait. Thus, any potential delay or cancellation of these bids may adversely impact its order inflows, the domestic brokerage said.\n\nIt still expects L&T to meet its FY26 order inflow growth guidance of 10 percent YoY due to the firm’s April-December order inflows of Rs 3.2 trillion and strong prospects for Q4 FY26. However, it cut its core order inflow estimates by 5-6 percent for FY26-28 to account for possible delay/cancellation in the Kuwait tenders.\n\n“This leads to ~3% cut in our core FY28E EBITDA; thus, a 3% fall in the stock price on 13th Jan’26 largely factors in such a deferral,” the brokerage said. Notably, the stock fell as much as 4.5 percent on November 13, before recovering some losses.\n\nJM Financial maintained its ‘Buy’ rating for the stock with a target price of Rs 4,500 per share, implying an upside potential of nearly 16 percent from the stock’s previous closing price.\n\nL&T shares fell 0.6 percent to trade at Rs 3,863.90 apiece, as seen at 1.20 pm. The stock has fallen around 7 percent in the past five days, and nearly 6 percent in the past one month. It however increased 11 percent in the past six months, and 12 percent in the past one year.\n\nThe stock currently has a P/E ratio of 27.93, and a market capitalization of nearly Rs 5.32 lakh crore.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.",
