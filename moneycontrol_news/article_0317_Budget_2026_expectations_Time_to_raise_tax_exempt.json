  "content": "India’s 14 crore-plus senior citizens are entering retirement with rising medical costs, low interest rates, and shrinking social security support, yet their tax structure has barely evolved.\n\nWhile the government has consistently signalled a preference for the new tax regime due to its simplicity, the old tax regime continues to matter for senior citizens. Medical expenses, insurance premiums, and interest-based income make deductions and higher exemption limits especially relevant for retirees.\n\nOne long-standing concern is the basic exemption limit of Rs 3 lakh for senior citizens, which was last revised in Budget 2014. Since then, healthcare costs and everyday expenses have climbed steadily, eroding purchasing power for those on fixed incomes. Industry experts believe targeted tax relief, either through higher exemption limits or senior-specific provisions, is both practical and overdue.\n\nChanges in basic exemption limit\n\nCurrently, the basic exemption limit stands at Rs 3 lakh for senior citizens and Rs 5 lakh for very senior citizens aged 80 years and above. The concept of very senior citizens was introduced under the Finance Act, 2011, which also raised the exemption limit for senior citizens from Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh. Since then, these thresholds have remained unchanged.\n\nExperts say Budget 2026 presents an opportunity to correct this long-pending gap.\n\nVijay Bharech, Partner at Deloitte India says, “These provisions have remained static for years despite rising living costs. A revision in exemption limits would offer meaningful relief to retirees who rely largely on passive income and help reduce compliance burdens.”\n\nThe sentiment is similar across the financial services ecosystem. Narendra Bharindwal, President of the Insurance Brokers Association of India, says, “A calibrated increase in exemption limits is overdue, particularly for retirees dependent on fixed incomes and savings, and can be implemented without materially impacting the overall tax base.”\n\nUnlike the old tax regime, the new tax regime does not offer age-based exemption limits, which experts say creates an uneven outcome for senior citizens. Bharech adds that rationalising exemption limits across both regimes could simplify compliance while ensuring higher disposable income for retirees.\n\nKirang Gandhi, a Pune-based financial mentor, points out, “While the new tax regime offers a universal Rs 4 lakh exemption, it overlooks the unique needs of senior citizens. With higher healthcare costs and limited income growth, a separate, higher exemption limit even under the new regime could help ensure financial dignity in retirement.”\n\nSenior citizens aged 60 years and above can currently claim a deduction of up to Rs 50,000 on interest income under Section 80TTB. This covers interest earned from savings accounts, fixed deposits, and recurring deposits. However, experts say these limits were set at a time when inflation was lower and interest income formed a smaller share of retirement expenses.\n\n“Interest income continues to be a lifeline for retirees, yet the rules around TDS and deductions remain outdated,” says Gandhi. He adds that increasing the Section 80TTB limit to Rs 75,000 or even Rs 1 lakh would help prevent avoidable tax deductions that disrupt monthly cash flows for senior citizens.\n\nSeparately, the TDS threshold under Section 194A was recently raised to Rs 1 lakh, meaning banks do not deduct tax if interest income stays within this limit. However, Bharech, of Deloitte India, points out, “For many senior citizens who depend largely on deposit interest, Rs 1 lakh may still fall short of covering regular expenses.”\n\nRaising the threshold further, experts argue, could reduce unnecessary TDS deductions and ease compliance and refund-related challenges for retirees.\n\nMedical inflation in India is estimated at 12-14 percent annually, significantly higher than overall inflation. Senior citizens bear the brunt of this trend, making existing Section 80D deduction limits increasingly inadequate.\n\n“Medical inflation is running well ahead of general inflation, and senior citizens face the highest burden,” says Bharindwal. He adds that enhancing Section 80D limits, particularly for seniors, would be a high-impact and socially relevant policy move.\n\nThere is also growing support for allowing health insurance deductions under the new tax regime. Bahroze Kamdin, Partner at Deloitte India, says “Health insurance premiums, including those paid for senior citizens, should be eligible for deductions regardless of the regime chosen.” With medical treatment and hospitalisation costs remaining high and public health coverage limited, tax relief can play a meaningful role.\n\nGlobally, several countries offer tax incentives for healthcare, either through deductions or tax credits. Kamdin adds, “Extending similar benefits in India could improve insurance adoption while offering direct relief to retirees.”\n\nIndustry experts point out that if the government is encouraging a shift to the new tax regime, senior citizens should not lose access to medical-related tax benefits in the process. Bharindwal suggests, “A simpler approach, would be to introduce limited, senior-specific deductions within the new regime, particularly for health insurance or critical illness covers, without complicating the tax structure.”",
