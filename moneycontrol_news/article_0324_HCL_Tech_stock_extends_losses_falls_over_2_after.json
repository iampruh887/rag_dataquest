  "content": "Shares of HCL Technologies deepened losses in late morning trade on Tuesday, slipping more than 2 percent as investors reacted to a largely cautious set of brokerage views following its Q3 FY26 results.\n\nHCL Techstock was trading 2.37 percent lower at Rs 1,628 around 10 am, hovering near the day’s low, underperforming a firmer broader market. The stock has now given up its pre-results gains and remains over 16 percent lower over the past year. That was also a key factor tempering sentiment even after a strong operational quarter. Broader market sentiment was positive, with benchmark indices NSE Nifty and BSE Sensex seeing moderate gains.\n\nBrokerages broadly acknowledged HCL Tech’s strong Q3 delivery, marked by robust deal wins, stable margins, and a guidance upgrade that places the company at the top end of the peer growth range. However, most analysts stopped short of turning bullish on the stock, flagging seasonality risks, valuation comfort, and historical return patterns as constraints on near-term performance.\n\nCiti maintained a Neutral rating with a target price of Rs 1,700, noting that while HCL Tech’s forward indicators and deal pipeline are stronger than peers, the current valuation leaves little room for sharp upside.\n\nHSBC and CLSA reiterated Hold calls, with CLSA highlighting that Q4 growth could turn sequentially negative due to seasonal weakness in the products business, a phase during which the stock has historically underperformed.\n\nAmong the brokerages, Nomura stood out with a Buy rating and a target of Rs 1,810, citing confidence in HCL Tech’s AI-led, services-driven growth strategy and expectations of margin normalisation in FY27.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
