  "content": "BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty  slipped moderately in early trade on Tuesday, as investors turned cautious amid fresh geopolitical concerns and persistent foreign fund selling. The benchmark equity indices pared part of Monday’s sharp rebound even as global cues remained supportive.\n\nAt 09:33 am, the indices were down around 0.2 percent, with the Sensex falling 185.45 points to 83,692.72 and the Nifty declining 55.95 points to 25,734.30. Market breadth, however, was positive, with 1,873 stocks advancing against 1,072 declines, while 187 shares were unchanged, suggesting selective buying even as headline indices remained under pressure.\n\nThe muted start comes a day after markets snapped a five-session losing streak on hopes of progress in India-US trade talks. That optimism was tempered on Tuesday after former US President Donald Trump said countries doing business with Iran would face a 25 percent tariff, reviving concerns around the weaponisation of trade policy. India has been among Iran’s key trading partners in recent years, exporting items such as rice, tea, medicines and textiles, while importing dry fruits and chemicals.\n\nSectoral performance was mixed in early trade. Gains in energy, metals and PSU banking stocks provided some support, while IT, auto and consumer durables stocks traded lower. Volatility remained elevated, with India VIX rising close to 2 percent, reflecting lingering nervousness after last week’s sharp correction.\n\nOn the Nifty, ONGC, Tech Mahindra, Hindalco Industries and HDFC Bank were among the early gainers, supported by selective buying. On the downside, Larsen & Toubro, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, HCL Technologies and Bharti Airtel weighed on the index.\n\nGlobally, sentiment was constructive. Asian equities traded higher, while US markets ended at record highs overnight, supported by gains in technology stocks and easing concerns around interest rates. Crude oil prices edged higher as worries over Iran-related supply disruptions offset expectations of increased output from Venezuela.\n\nAnalysts say the Nifty’s ability to hold above the 25,650-25,700 zone will be crucial in the near term after Monday’s rebound. A sustained move above 25,800 could open the door for a further recovery towards the 25,900-26,000 zone, while a slip below recent lows may revive downside pressure. With Q3 earnings underway and geopolitical developments in focus, participants expect stock-specific action to dominate in the sessions ahead.\n\nInstitutional flows remain a key swing factor. Foreign institutional investors sold equities worth about Rs 3,638 crore on January 12, extending their selling streak to a sixth consecutive session, while domestic institutional investors continued to provide support with net purchases of over Rs 5,800 crore, helping cushion the broader market.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
