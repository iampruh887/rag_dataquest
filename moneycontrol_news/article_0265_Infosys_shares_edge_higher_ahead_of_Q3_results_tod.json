  "content": "Shares of IT majorInfosyswere trading 0.3% higher at Rs 1,603 apiece on January 14 ahead of December quarter results, scheduled to be announced in the post-market hours.\n\nAnalysts, on average, expect Q3 consolidated revenue of Rs 45,227 crore versus Rs 41,764 crore last year, as per data compiled by LSEG.\n\nInfosys is not expected to upgrade 2026 annual revenue forecast of 3% to 5%, as per data compiled by LSEG.\n\nRival Tata Consultancy Services posted third-quarter revenue marginally above estimates on AI-driven demand\n\nHCL Tech narrowed its annual revenue growth forecast to 4% to 4.5% from 3% to 5% previously, banking on a growing deal book.\n\nSeasonal furloughs to keep sequential revenue growth flat and operating margins to be steady in the absence of wage hikes, brokerages said of expectations from Infosys results.\n\nIn 2025, Infosys shares fell 14% while Nifty IT index fell 12.6%.\n\nMotilal Oswal Financial Services, earlier this week, said it sees up to 33% upside potential for Infosys stock.\n\n\"Infosys is well placed to benefit from enterprise-wide AI spending, given its discretionary-heavy mix. At the current valuations, upside risks meaningfully outweigh downside risks. We value INFO at 26x FY28E EPS with a TP of INR2,150, implying a 33% upside potential. Infosysremains our top pick among tier-1 IT names and we reiterate our BUY rating on the stock.\"\n\nThe recent strategic collaboration between Infosys (INFO) and Cognition (Devin) is worth highlighting, said the brokerage. Under this partnership, Infosys will deploy DEVIN, Cognition’s “AI software engineer”, across Infosys' internal teams and client delivery.\n\n\"We anticipate Infosys will increase its FY26E revenue growth guidance by 1% to 3-4% (low ask rate for 2H). Infosys is likely to maintain a margin band of 20-22%,\" said HDFC Securities.",
