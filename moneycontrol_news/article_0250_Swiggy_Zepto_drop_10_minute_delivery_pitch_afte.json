  "content": "Quick commerce firms Swiggy and IPO-bound Zepto have altered the branding of their rapid delivery services, moving away from explicitly marketing them as \"10-minute\" deliveries, following a government directive, a Reuters report said on Wednesday.\n\nOn Tuesday that the government had instructed Eternal's Blinkit, Zepto and Swiggy to stop promoting grocery deliveries under the \"10-minute\" promise. The move comes amid concerns over rider safety and labour practices, with fears that strict delivery timelines encourage rash driving and penalise workers for delays.\n\nIndia's quick-commerce sector, currently valued at about $11.5 billion, has faced growing scrutiny, according to data from Datum Intelligence.\n\n\"The removal of the 10-minute delivery catchline is largely optics-driven rather than business-altering,\" said Karan Taurani, executive vice president at Elara Capital. \"Quick commerce continues to be anchored in speed, convenience and proximity-led fulfilment, which remains structurally superior to traditional e-commerce timelines,\" he added.\n\nEternal clarified on Tuesday that there has been no change to Blinkit's underlying business model. Zepto declined to comment, while Swiggy did not immediately respond to a Reuters query.\n\nSources told Reuters that the labour ministry raised the issue during a closed-door meeting on Saturday with representatives of the three companies, urging them to stop advertising deliveries as a 10-minute service.\n\nDespite the branding shift, competition in India's quick-commerce space remains intense, with companies investing billions to expand dark store networks as urban consumers increasingly opt for ultra-fast delivery of items ranging from groceries to electronics.",
