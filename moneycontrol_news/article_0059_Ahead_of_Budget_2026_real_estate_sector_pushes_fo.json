  "content": "As the Union Budget 2026 draws near, India’s real estate sector has urged the government to grant the sector an industry status, digitise land records and introduce a simplified single-window clearance mechanism to accelerate approvals and revive demand.\n\nIndustry bodies and developers argue that recognising real estate as an “industry” would unlock cheaper long-term institutional credit, lower borrowing costs and broader access to structured financing.\n\nDevelopers said that industry status has been a long-pending demand and they remain optimistic, expecting sustained policy support in the budget.\n\n“The real estate sector currently contributes around 7 percent to India’s GDP and supports over 200 allied industries. Granting industry status to real estate sector would improve access to institutional funding and enable the sector to play a stronger role in job creation and economic growth. Real estate has the potential to contribute up to 15 percent to India’s GDP by 2047 with the help of adequate policy support,”Signature Global (India) Ltdfounder and chairman Pradeep Aggarwal has said.\n\nTribeca Developers group CEO Rajat Khandelwal said the sector is looking for policy continuity that supports both supply and demand. “Granting industry status to real estate remains crucial, as it would ease access to long-term capital; lower borrowing costs, and improve execution efficiency for developers,” he said.\n\nKhandelwal said real estate growth is closely tied to infrastructure. Increased investments in urban infrastructure, public transport and smart city initiatives will not only make cities liveable but also strengthen the realty sector.\n\nSterling Developers chairman and managing director Ramani Sastri said industry status will help the real estate sector realise its full potential, as it will unlock affordable funding and streamline regulatory processes.\n\n“Overall, we would like to see announcements to enhance ease of doing business for the developers to create positive climate for real estate investment,” he said.\n\nSingle-window clearance and digitisation of land records\n\nDevelopers have also sought single-window clearances, consolidating approvals from multiple authorities on a unified digital platform. It will cut the red tape, reduce project gestation periods and enhance transparency, they have argued.\n\nTRG Group MD Shorab Upadhyay said realtors are looking forward to a Union Budget that brings in stability, liquidity and confidence in the real estate sector.\n\n“We expect better policy support towards faster project approvals, single-window clearances, and digitisation of land records, which are much-needed steps in substantially enhancing ease of doing business and accelerating delivery timelines,” he said.\n\nNotandas Realty managing director  Harsh Jagwani said a single-window clearance system is “long overdue” and capable of accelerating approvals and injecting much-needed efficiency into project execution.\n\nThe government should also bring reforms in the digitisation process of land as well as property acquisition. “This will not only help in accelerating the pace of development of new projects but also ease the process of buying new homes for homebuyers in general. Cleaner land-title system, stricter escrow enforcement under RERA will also help reduce transaction risk and financing delays,” he said.",
