Nyati added that grey market trends have further strengthened positive sentiment around the stock. According to her, the sharp rise in GMP points to expectations of listing gains of about 62 per cent over the issue price, reflecting strong demand at debut.

According to him, interest in the issue was largely driven by its scarcity value, as the IPO offered a rare chance to gain exposure to India's largest and most integrated player in the coking coal value chain, which is a key input for the domestic steel industry.\n\nBharat Coking Coal Share Price Live: Grey market signals strong listing premium\n\nAhead of the listing, grey market trends suggest a robust debut.
