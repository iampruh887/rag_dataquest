  "content": "Motilal Oswal's research report onInfosys\n\nWe have argued in our recent upgrade note (Time to buy the next cycle, 24th Nov 2025) that 2026 will be the year when enterprises start deploying AI at scale, and Indian IT services stand to benefit from this. While nearterm demand signals remain choppy, our analysis suggests that the AI services layer is gradually starting to take shape. The recent strategic collaboration between Infosys (INFO) and Cognition (Devin) is worth highlighting. Under this partnership, INFO will deploy DEVIN, Cognition’s “AI software engineer”, across INFO’s internal teams and client delivery.\n\nAt the current valuations, upside risks meaningfully outweigh downside risks. We value INFO at 26x FY28E EPS with a TP of INR2,150, implying a 33% upside potential. INFO remains our top pick among tier-1 IT names and we reiterate our BUY rating on the stock.\n\nFor all recommendations report,click here\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
