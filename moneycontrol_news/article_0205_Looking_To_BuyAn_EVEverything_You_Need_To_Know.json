Fancy jumping on the ‘Go-Green’ bandwagon? Well, electric vehicles (EVs) are definitely\n\t\t\t\t\tone way to go about it. EVs are no longer just a hope for the future, they are here right now and on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe cusp of a revolution. As is the case with anything new, the fear of the unknown is real. To\n\t\t\t\t\tallay those fears and help you make an informed decision, here is our comprehensive primer on EVs.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe technology, why it is better, challenges, global picture, and a journey through the history\n\t\t\t\t\tbooks—we have it all covered. It is everything you need to know about EVs.\n\nThere’s no engine oil to change, in fact no engine to maintain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat all. Also, fewer moving parts, no belt or chain to be serviced, no transmission fluid to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanged, no clogged-up valves or burnt clutch plate and no sweat over emission tests. So, what\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoes maintaining an EV entail?\n\nInput the values in the boxes with ‘*’ to calculate the running cost\n\t\t\t\tof an electric car as compared to a traditional car\n\nNumber should be greater than 0\n\nLocalised electric vehicle battery manufacturing may in fact be the only way to realise India’s EV market potential and help the government meet its target of 30% private EV sales by 2030. Currently, both EV batteries and cells are imported and account for about 40-50% of the EV’s total cost. Manufacturing the lithium-ion cells to make the batteries in India would make them cheaper, faster, and allow for large-scale manufacturing! In fact, even Tesla’s Elon Musk recently announced plans to halve battery costs through in-house battery cell engineering! Watch this episode of Drive Report to understand how manufacturing batteries in India will completely change the EV game!\n\nThe road to electrification has been long and bumpy.Contrary\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto popular belief, the electric car is not a recent invention and predates the internal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcombustion car by nearly 50 years. Here’s a look at the rise, decline and revival of EVs.\n\nFirst motorised electric carriage is built. While the actual year\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis disputed, a Scotsman named Robert Anderson is credited with creating the first\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcrude electric vehicle while another Scotsman named Robert Davidson built a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprototype electric locomotive in 1837. Capable of towing 6 tons, it had\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-rechargeable batteries and a severely limited range of 3 km. Rechargeable ones\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twouldn’t be invented until 1859.\n\n‘Electrobat’, first commercial electric car comes out. Top Speed –\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t36kph | Range – 40km. It goes on to serve as a cab. US President Theodore Roosevelt\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecame the first president to take a ride in the car.\n\nBelgian builder Camille Jenatzy builds the first EV to break the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t100kph speed barrier.\n\nFerdinand Porsche builds the first hybrid electric car.\n\nFord Model T arrives and alters the course of history. It is the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst mass produced internal combustion car. Costs half as much as an EV and is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresistant to extreme heat and Detroit’s chilly winters. By 1912, costs about $300, a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfraction of EVs.\n\nFossil fuel powered cars completely outclasses EVs.\n\nBy the end of WWII, EV makers had either gone bust or converted to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfossil fuel.\n\nHenney Kilowatt is produced. Of the 100 produced, only 47 were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsold.\n\nGeneral Motors comes out with Electrovair II. But its batteries\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcould only last 100 recharge cycles. A new pack at the time would cost $1,60,000. A\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLamborghini 350GT at the time would only cost $5,480.\n\nNASA’s Apollo 15 lunar mission required the use of a car/rover on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe moon. The Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) is produced. It is popularly called the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t‘Moon Buggy’.\n\nThe 70s fuel prices skyrocket due to an OPEC-imposed oil embargo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEVs were once again in focus and the Sebring-Vanguard Citicar and Comuta car became\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpopular. The latter became the largest electric car produced in the US; a record\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeaten by Tesla in 2013.\n\nChevrolet comes out with the Electrovette. But after fuel prices\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdipped, eVette’s low range, low speed and outdated battery tech led to its undoing.\n\nChetan Maini’s Reva Electric is set up.\n\nGM produces the EV1m the first mass-produced and purpose-designed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\telectric vehicle of the modern era.\n\nReva-I, also called G-Wiz in European markets is launched. It is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndia’s first production EV and the world’s first, truly affordable EV.s\n\nAfter failing to convince AC Propulsion to put its\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfast-accelerating prototype ‘Tzero’ into production, Martin Eberhard and Elon Musk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjoin forces and use the tech under license to form a little-known brand called Tesla\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMotors.\n\nTesla Roadster is launched. It becomes the first lithium-ion\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbattery powered production EV and the first EV to cover 320km on a single charge.\n\nEV startups like Rivian and Rimac are launched. Rimac goes on to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduce the Rimac One – the fastest production electric vehicle. Rimac Two hits\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0-100kph in 1.9 secs.\n\nTesla Model S revolutionises the EV market with its mix of space,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperformance and long-distance driving capabilities.\n\nChevrolet re-enters the EV market with Bolt. Tesla launches Model\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3.\n\nElon Musk debuts the Tesla Cybertruck concept.\n\nJaguar, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and BMW announce plans to go\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tall-electric by the end of the decade.\n\nToyota plans to launch EV featuring new technology called\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t‘solid-state batteries’ by 2024.\n\nElectricity was not readily accessible as it is today. Only few cities in the US had\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccess to electricity at the time. Hence, electric cars were not a viable option for many.\n\nEVs at the time were mostly used for short distances. As road infrastructure got\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetter, the need for long distance drives became a necessity which EVs at the time could not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeet.\n\nAfter the discovery of Texas crude oil, gasoline prices plummeted making it\n\t\t\t\t\t\taffordable to the average consumer. This led to cheaper operating costs.\n\nHenry Ford made car buying cheaper with the introduction of the Ford Model T which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcost a fraction of what EVs cost at the time. That, along with the invention of the electric\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstarter meant gasoline cars were easier to operate.\n\nFollowing the dip in oil price, gasoline cars started getting cheaper. By 1912, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprice gap between gasoline cars and EV widened. Al electric roadster in 1912 sold for $1750\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile a gasoline car cost just $650. Ford cars were also available in the $500 - $1000 range.\n\n2019 – 2030 Demand growth in the EV industry\n\nCopper, nickel and lithium are some of the key metals used\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin EV battery production\n\nThe demand for EVs is driving the demand for metals, with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmore and more manufacturers joining the EV bandwagon\n\nAccording to Wright’s Law, lithium-ion battery costs fall by 28%\n\t\t\t\t\tfor every cumulative doubling of units produced. The battery pack is the most expensive component of\n\t\t\t\t\tan EV. Thus, the sticker prices of EVs fall as battery costs decline. Some EVs are already cheaper\n\t\t\t\t\tto own and operate than comparable gasoline powered cars due to the cost saved from fuel,\n\t\t\t\t\tmaintenance, and resale value\n\nSensex TodayBharat Coking Coal Share PriceMumbai BMC Election ResultsMaharashtra Election ResultsInfosys Share PricePune Election ResultsOld Tax RegimeNobel Peace Prize medalGold PriceAmazon Great Republic Day Sale\n\nBusinessMarketsStocksIndia NewsCity NewsEconomyMutual FundsPersonal FinanceIPO NewsStartups\n\nHomeCurrenciesCommoditiesPre-MarketIPOGlobal MarketBonds\n\nHomeLoans up to 50 LakhsCredit Cards Lifetime FreeFinance TrackerNewFixed DepositsFixed Deposit ComparisonFixed Income\n\nHomeMC 30Top Ranked FundsETFsMutual Fund Screener\n\nIncome Tax CalculatorEMI CalculatorRetirement PlanningGratuity CalculatorPetrol Price in IndiaDiesel Price in IndiaIFSC Code\n\nNews18FirstpostCNBC TV18News18 HindiCricketnextOverdrive\n\nAbout UsContact UsAdvisory AlertAdvertise with UsSupportDisclaimerPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyTerms & ConditionsFinancial Terms (Glossary)SitemapInvestors\n\nCopyright © Network18 Media & Investments Limited.
