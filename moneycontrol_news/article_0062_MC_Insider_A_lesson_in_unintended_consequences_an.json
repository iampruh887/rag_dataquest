What did they get instead? A masterclass in unintended consequences.\n\nThe promoter didn’t blink, investment bankers couldn’t do much, and the issue sailed through with the same allocation. The protestors stayed out, and the stock proceeded to list with 50% gains, one of the best debuts of the year.\n\nNow the worry is this: Has the protest actually emboldened promoters? If issuers realise they can hard-code allocations, push aside banker advice, and still walk out heroes on listing day, the power equation in IPO cap-table construction may tilt sharply in their favour. Ouch.\n\nRally Protest GIFfromRally GIFs\n\nThis storied investor has had a standout 2025 thanks to some early bets paying off. But there’s no sign of him slowing down. We hear the investor, always great at spotting and chasing momentum, is increasingly spending time in the US, the heart of all AI action.\n\nWhat’s more, has even bought a villa belonging to a former American athlete for a cool $20 million.\n\nExpect a lot more AI bets and US-led announcements from this fund in 2026.\n\nTemptation Island GIFfromTemptation Island GIFs\n\nNote to the Readers :Chances are you love a juicy story as much as we hacks do and you might have one to\n          share.
