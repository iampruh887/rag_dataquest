  "content": "The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has announced the rollout of the Single Window Automatic and Generalised Access for Trusted Foreign Investors (SWAGAT–FI) framework, aimed at simplifying registration and compliance for foreign investors.\n\nSEBI in two circulars released on Friday has enabled a unified registration process across multiple investment routes for Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) and Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs). The framework also seeks to minimise repeated compliance requirements and documentation, thereby reducing the regulatory burden on eligible investors.\n\nThe benefits of SWAGAT–FI, according to the regulator will be available to both existing and new FPIs that meet the specified eligibility criteria. Investors registered with SEBI such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, appropriately regulated and broad-based mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds are expected to be the primary beneficiaries.\n\nThe framework follows earlier amendments to the SEBI (FPI) Regulations, 2019 and the SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2000, which provided for the introduction of SWAGAT–FI for FPIs and FVCIs.\n\nThe provisions of the circulars will come into effect from June 1, 2026.",
