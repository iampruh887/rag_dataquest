Elevated volatility, along with cautious technical and momentum indicators, suggests bulls remain tentative as markets await further cues from the ongoing earnings season. Experts believe the index is likely to take a decisive direction only after a clear breakout from the current range. On the downside, a breach below 25,600 could open the door to 25,450, while a move above 25,900 may pave the way for a rally toward the 26,000–26,100 zone. Global cues remain mixed, though GIFT Nifty indicates a steady start for Dalal Street. On the stock-specific front, Infosys will be in focus following its guidance upgrade, while Reliance Industries is set to report its Q3 earnings today. Markets will also track the outcome of the BMC election results, due later in the day.
