  "content": "Foreign investors (FIIs/FPIs) net sold nearly Rs 1500 crore worth of Indian equities on Wednesday, January 13. At the same time, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) net bought shares worth Rs 1182 crore, according to provisional exchange data.\n\nDuring the session, DIIs purchased shares worth Rs 15,445 crore and sold shares worth Rs 14,263 crore. On the other hand, FIIs bought shares worth Rs 13,495 crore, but sold shares totalling Rs 11,995 crore.\n\nFor the year so far, FIIs have been net sellers of shares worth Rs 16,921  crore, while DIIs have net bought shares worth Rs 24,923 lakh crore.\n\nAt close, the Sensex was down 250.48 points or 0.30 percent at 83,627.69, and the Nifty was down 57.95 points or 0.22 percent at 25,732.30.\n\nMixed performance was seen among the broader indices, with the BSE Midcap index declining 0.2 percent, while the Smallcap index rose 0.5 percent.\n\nOn today's market, Ajit Mishra – SVP, Research, Religare Broking noted that markets remained volatile on the weekly expiry day and ended marginally lower amid mixed cues. \"Market action reflects the interplay between earnings-related reactions and global uncertainty. Early optimism was supported by encouraging IT earnings and signs of progress in India–U.S. trade discussions, which lifted sentiment in the first half. However, the lack of follow-through and fresh selling in heavyweights across sectors capped the upside. Ongoing geopolitical and global trade concerns also continued to weigh on risk appetite, keeping trading largely stock-specific,\" he said.\n\nMishra added that they maintain a cautious view on the Nifty and suggest continuing with a sell-on-rise approach until the index decisively reclaims the 26,000 level. \"A decisive breach of medium-term 100-day EMA, placed near 25,600, could accelerate the decline toward the 25,400 zone. Given the earnings season and fluctuating global cues, it is prudent to stay light and wait for clearer confirmation of the next directional move. Participants should focus on stock-specific opportunities and prefer a hedged approach amid the prevailing choppiness,\" he added.",
