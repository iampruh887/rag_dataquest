  "content": "Bharat Coking Coal Ltd(BCCL) shares are scheduled to be listed on the stock exchanges on Monday, following strong investor demand for the company’s initial public offering (IPO), which was subscribed 147 times on the final day of bidding on Tuesday.\n\nThe IPO was fully subscribed within minutes of opening for subscription on January 9. Earlier, the company raised over Rs 273 crore from anchor investors.\n\nThe Rs 1,071-crore IPO, the first mainboard issue of 2026, was offered in a price band of Rs 21 to Rs 23 per share.\n\nMarket analysts have advised investors to consider booking partial profits after listing, citing strong listing expectations but limited near-term upside.\n\nPrashanth Tapse, Research Analyst at Mehta Equities, said the stock is expected to list at a premium. \"We expect BCCL to list at a price of Rs 32–35, implying a premium of 39–52 percent over the issue price. The IPO witnessed exceptionally strong subscription across QIB, NII and retail segments,\" he said.\n\nTapse added that in the event of listing gains exceeding 50 percent, investors may consider booking profits on part of their holdings while retaining the rest for the long term. He also cautioned non-allotted investors against chasing the stock on listing day due to possible volatility.\n\nMahesh M Ojha, Vice President – Research and Business Development at Kantilal Chhaganlal Securities, said investors with a long-term perspective may continue to hold the stock, while short-term investors could consider booking partial gains at listing.\n\nShivani Nyati, Head of Wealth at Swastika Investmart, said strong subscription numbers and positive grey market signals indicate a confident outlook at listing, though investors should remain mindful of sector cyclicality.\n\nNarendra Solanki, Head of Fundamental Research – Investment Services at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, said the company is expected to list at a decent premium given the demand seen during the IPO. However, he noted that valuations appear fully priced at the upper end of the issue price and advised allotted investors to book profits on listing.\n\nThe listing of Bharat Coking Coal is part of the government’s divestment programme in Coal India subsidiaries. In its prospectus, the company said the IPO would help it achieve the benefits of listing.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
