At the same time, it is a tremendous task financially and most people usually take out a home loan to fulfil it. The tenure of a home loan can go up to 30 years.\n\nFor many, the burden of a home loan can feel overwhelming. Though it allows you to buy or build a home, the thought of paying EMIs for decades could be challenging.\n\nTo reduce the financial burden, home loan early repayment could be a suitable option. It can save you interest costs and relieve you of debt. Here are some ways to successfully achieve home loan early repayment.\n\nThere are several banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) which offer home loans in India. To get the best deal, you must compare the terms and conditions which different lenders prescribe for their loans.\n\nIn case you want a personal loan, you can visit the Moneycontrol app. You can borrowup to Rs 50 lakhswith interest rates starting from 10.5% per annum. You won’t be asked to provide any collateral for these loans and the entire application process is 100% digital.\n\nHere are some of the things you can do for early home loan repayment:\n\nIf you have taken a floating rate home loan, then you will not be charged a penalty for making a prepayment. You can take advantage of this provision to clear your debt early. Prepayments directly lower the principal, lowering future interest calculations.\n\nIf your income increases, you consider increasing your EMI correspondingly. If you pay higher EMIs consistently, you can reduce your loan tenure significantly. However, it is important to do thorough planning, as there are other expenses you have to take care of as well.\n\n3. Opt for a Shorter Loan Tenure\n\nIf you want to reduce the duration for which you are indebted, one of the most obvious things to do is to choose a loan with a shorter tenure. Shorter tenures mean higher EMIs but lower total interest. You need to do proper financial planning to ensure that it is the right option for you.\n\nUse bonuses, tax refunds, or other windfalls to make lump-sum prepayments. For example, if you receive a bonus, use it for prepaying the principal. Unexpected financial gains, such as mutual fund returns or inheritance, can be directed towards loan prepayment.\n\n5. Earn Additional Income And Cut Unnecessary Expenses\n\nYou can supplement your primary income with side hustles or investments to fund prepayments. Further, you can also review your monthly expenses to see if you can cut out unnecessary expenses so that you can increase the prepayment amount.\n\nCheck loan options for all needs\n\nFactors to consider before home loan early repayment\n\nPrepayment Charges:Some fixed-rate loans may have prepayment penalties. You must study the terms and conditions of the loan thoroughly to decide whether you should opt for prepayment.\n\nTax Benefits:Under the Income Tax Act, 1961, you can claim a tax deduction of up to Rs 2 lakh for home loan interest and up to Rs 1.5 lakh on the principal. Early repayment may reduce these benefits. So, it is important to compare the tax savings against interest savings.\n\nOther Financial Goals:It is crucial to balance home loan repayment with goals like retirement, education or healthcare. You must do proper financial planning before starting prepayments.\n\nEMI Calculators:Use online calculators from banks like and online platforms to calculate savings from prepayments and increasing the EMI.\n\nEmergency Fund:Before you start home loan early repayment in India, you must build an emergency fund which can sustain you for at least six to twelve months. This will keep you prepared for unexpected worst-case scenarios.\n\nIf you are looking for a personal loan with attractive terms and conditions, you can check the Moneycontrol app. You can borrowup to Rs 50 lakh from top lendersthrough the app. The interest rates start from 10.5% per annum.
