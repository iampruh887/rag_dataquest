  "content": "Dassault Aviation, the French aerospace major and maker of the Rafale fighter jets operated by the Indian Air Force, has entered into a strategic partnership with defence AI firm Harmattan AI to accelerate the integration of controlled autonomy and artificial intelligence into next-generation combat aviation systems.\n\nAs part of the collaboration, Dassault Aviation is leading Harmattan AI’s $200 million Series B funding round, signalling a major push to embed sovereign and monitored AI technologies into future air combat platforms.\n\nThe collaboration will support the development of AI capabilities in Dassault Aviation’s future air combat systems, particularly for controlling unmanned aerial systems, or drones, the companies said on Monday.\n\nDassault is currently working on a new version of its Rafale fighter jet, the Rafale F5, which is expected to enter service around 2030. The company is also developing a combat drone under the “unmanned combat air system” programme, designed to operate alongside the Rafale F5 in future combat missions.\n\nHarmattan AI said in a post on LinkedIn that its Series B funding round has valued the company at $1.4 billion, underscoring growing investor confidence in AI-driven defence technologies.\n\nReacting to the development, French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed the partnership, highlighting its strategic significance.\n\n“This is excellent news for our strategic autonomy, for the technological superiority of our military in the area of AI-enabled defence drones as well as for our economy,” Macron said in a post on X.\n\nHarmattan AI has already secured multiple Programs of Record from the French and UK Ministries of Defence for its autonomous systems portfolio and is now expanding globally amid rising demand for AI-enabled military capabilities. The fresh funding will be used to deploy AI-driven missions across new operational theatres, expand into additional defence domains, and scale industrial manufacturing of its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), drone interception and electronic warfare platforms.\n\n“Dassault Aviation has always placed technological excellence and sovereignty at the heart of its values. This partnership with Harmattan AI reflects our commitment to integrating high-value autonomy into the next generation of combat air systems. By joining forces with a fast-moving and innovative company, we reinforce our ability to deliver the advanced capabilities required by our armed forces in the decades ahead,” said Eric Trappier, Chairman and CEO of Dassault Aviation.\n\nThe partnership will support the development of embedded AI capabilities by Harmattan AI within Dassault Aviation’s future air combat systems, including the Rafale F5 upgrade and unmanned combat aerial systems (UCAS), with a particular focus on controlling unmanned aerial platforms. The collaboration aligns with Dassault’s broader strategy to integrate sovereign, controlled and monitored AI into its combat systems.\n\n“This partnership with Dassault Aviation marks a decisive step in the emergence of a new generation of autonomous defense systems. Dassault Aviation’s trust and leadership accelerate our mission: delivering scalable, sovereign AI capabilities to allied forces. By combining frontier AI with world-class military aviation expertise, we are shaping the future of collaborative air combat,” said Mouad M’Ghari, CEO and Co-Founder of Harmattan AI.\n\nDassault Aviation will contribute its deep expertise in system architecture for complex military platforms, mission system integration in high-intensity operational environments, and international business development through its global defence network.",
