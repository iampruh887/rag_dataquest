  "content": "The Centre on Wednesday (January 14) launched the Paripoorna Mediclaim Ayush Bima, an optional health insurance plan for central government health scheme (CGHS) beneficiaries.\n\nThe policy will offer cashless facilities, modern treatments and access to a wide network of hospitals, the government’s official statement read.\n\nKey features of Paripoorna Mediclaim Ayush Bima\n\nThe Paripoorna Mediclaim Ayush Bima is available as a retail product for central government employees,  which can be availed as an individual or family floater plan with an option to add up to six members per policy. The sum-insured options are available for Rs 10 lakh or Rs 20 lakh coverage.\n\nThe government said that the policy will soon be made available for purchase at the offices as well as the online platform of New India Assurance Company Limited, the government-owned general insurance company.\n\nHere’s a guide to walk you through the Paripoorna Mediclaim Ayush Bima:\n\nThe Paripoorna Mediclaim Ayush Bima is an optional health scheme designed to complement existing health schemes for CGHS beneficiaries, who are primarily the central government employees and pensioners, and their eligible dependent family members.\n\nA CGHS beneficiary has the option to avail of a sum insured cover of either Rs 10 lakh or Rs 20 lakh. Remember, the premium will vary based on the chosen SI amount.\n\nThe policy comes with a co-payment option, wherein the hospitalisation cost is distributed among subscribers and the insurer, in either a 70:30 ratio or a 50:50 ratio.\n\nOpting for the co-payment option allows the insured to receive a 28% premium discount under a 70:30 cost-sharing arrangement and a 42% discount under a 50:50 cost-sharing ratio.\n\nFor every claim-free year, the sum insured increases by 10% at no additional cost, compounding annually up to a maximum of 100% of the base cover.\n\nParipoorna Mediclaim Ayush Bima offers CGHS beneficiaries a flexible, cashless health insurance option that enhances existing coverage with higher sum insured, modern treatments, and premium discounts. Designed as a supplement rather than a replacement, it helps central government employees and pensioners strengthen their health protection with added choice and convenience.\n\nThat being said, the policy wording isn’t yet crystal clear in terms of premiums, exclusions, pre-existing disease and deduction, to cite an example. The beneficiaries are advised to consult these clauses carefully with the insurer before taking up the health plan.",
