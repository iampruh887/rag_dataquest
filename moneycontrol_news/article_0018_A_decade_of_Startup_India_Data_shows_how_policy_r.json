  "content": "Startup India has completed ten years with government data showing a structural reset of India’s startup ecosystem, marked by a sharp rise in recognised startups, job creation, capital inflows and faster exits, as policy reforms dismantled long-standing barriers around funding, regulation and market access.\n\nLaunched in 2016, the initiative has moved India from a fragmented, high-risk entrepreneurial environment to a pipeline-driven startup system backed by institutional capital, simplified compliance and access to public markets.\n\nFrom idea-stage failure to institutional seed funding\n\nBefore 2016, early-stage innovation in India routinely failed to secure formal backing, with the lack of seed capital cited as the primary constraint by young firms. Angel funding was limited, geographically concentrated and largely dependent on personal networks.\n\nThis gap was addressed through the Startup India Seed Fund Scheme, launched in 2021 with a Rs 945 crore corpus. As of 2025, 219 incubators across India have been approved to deploy seed capital for proof of concept, prototyping and market entry.\n\nOver the same period, formal recognition expanded sharply. The number of startups recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade rose from around 500 in 2016 to over 2.09 lakh by 2025, shifting innovation from anecdotal success to an institutional pipeline.\n\nScale finance redesigned through public anchoring\n\nScaling beyond the early stage remained a systemic weakness prior to 2016, with venture capital flows prone to sharp pullbacks and limited domestic risk capital.\n\nThis was addressed through the Fund of Funds for Startups, a Rs 10,000 crore programme managed by Small Industries Development Bank of India. Government commitments of over Rs 11,800 crore have been channelled through more than 150 SEBI-registered AIFs, which have collectively invested over Rs 22,900 crore in more than 1,270 startups.\n\nDebt access was expanded through the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups, launched in 2022, enabling collateral-freeloansof up to Rs 20 crore. More than Rs 750 crore in loans have been guaranteed within three years.\n\nOver the past decade, Indian startups and emerging enterprises have attracted over $150 billion in private investment across venture capital, private equity and growth funding.\n\nCompliance reforms reduce regulatory risk\n\nRegulatory uncertainty was a major deterrent before Startup India, with startups subject to the same inspection and compliance regimes as large firms.\n\nSince 2016, more than 47,000 compliances have been reduced, over 4,458 legal provisions decriminalised and more than 64 regulatory reforms introduced. DPIIT-recognised startups are allowed to self-certify compliance with nine labour laws and three environmental laws, avoiding inspections for up to five years.\n\nFast-track exit mechanisms under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code now allow eligible startups to close operations within 90 days, compared with years under the earlier framework.\n\nPublic procurement opens as a market\n\nLack of credible domestic buyers had previously limited scale. Government procurement rules mandating prior turnover and experience effectively excluded startups.\n\nThese requirements were relaxed for recognised startups, allowing participation based on technical capability. Through the Government e-Marketplace, startups have executed transactions worth over Rs 38,500 crore, with more than 30,000 startups participating by 2025.\n\nThis shift repositioned the state as an early customer rather than just a regulator.\n\nExits and capital recycling gain legitimacy\n\nExit constraints had long penalised failure and discouraged repeat entrepreneurship. Alongside fast-track closures, angel tax provisions were amended to exempt investments from accredited investors, AIFs and non-residents. Eligible startups can also claim 100% income tax exemption for three years within their first ten years.\n\nIndia is now among the world’s most active IPO markets. The number of unicorns has risen from four in 2014 to around 120–125 active unicorns by 2025, with a combined valuation exceeding $350 billion.\n\nNew sectors move into the mainstream\n\nThe policy framework has enabled the emergence of new growth sectors. India now has over 1,000 defence startups, more than 380 space startups, nearly 5,000 agritech startups and close to 900 generative AI startups.\n\nGovernment-backed procurement, sector-specific missions and capital support have allowed these firms to move from pilots to deployment, embedding startups into defence, space, agriculture and digital infrastructure.\n\nWhat the data shows after 10 years\n\nIndia is now the world’s third-largest startup ecosystem, growing at 12–15% annually. Startups have generated over 21 lakh jobs, with more than 44,000 new startups added in 2025 alone. Startup shutdowns fell to a five-year low in 2025, indicating a shift from experimentation to sustainability.",
