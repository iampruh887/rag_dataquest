  "content": "If you have a mobile phone and a bank account, you’ve probably received them. Calls that begin with “Sir/Ma’am, you are eligible for a special personal loan” or “We have an exclusive car loan offer just for you”. They sound helpful, timely, sometimes even reassuring. Low interest, instant disbursal, minimal paperwork.\n\nWhen money feels tight or a purchase is looming, these calls can feel like a lifeline. But they can also be the start of a very expensive mistake.\n\nWhy these calls are so persistent\n\nBanks, NBFCs and loan aggregators are under pressure to grow their retail loan books. Personalloansand auto loans are among the most profitable products they sell. Cold calls, WhatsApp messages and app notifications are simply the cheapest way to push credit quickly.\n\nNot all such calls are fraudulent. Some do come from legitimate lenders or their authorised agents. The problem is that the urgency is artificial. The loan is being sold to you, not tailored for you.\n\n“Pre-approved” doesn’t mean pre-cheap\n\nOne of the most misleading phrases used in these calls is “pre-approved”. It creates a sense of safety, as if the lender has already vetted you and decided the loan is good for you.\n\nIn reality, pre-approval usually just means you meet basic eligibility criteria based on your credit profile. The interest rate, fees and fine print still matter, and these are often revealed only after you show interest.\n\nMany borrowers realise too late that the rate quoted on the phone was conditional, or that processing fees, insurance add-ons and penalties quietly pushed up the real cost.\n\nWhen easy money becomes expensive money\n\nPersonal loans are unsecured, which makes them convenient but also costly. Interest rates can vary widely depending on your credit score, employer profile and lender. What sounds “reasonable” on a call can still be far higher than alternatives like a top-up on an existing loan or a credit card balance transfer.\n\nAuto loans, while secured, can also hide surprises. Longer tenures reduce EMIs but increase total interest. Dealer-linked loans may bundle higher rates in exchange for faster approval or discounts elsewhere.\n\nThe danger isn’t borrowing. It’s borrowing without comparing.\n\nHow desperation clouds judgement\n\nThese calls work best when you’re vulnerable. A medical expense, a sudden job gap, a tight month, a delayed payment. That’s when instant approval sounds like relief.\n\nThis is also when borrowers are least likely to read documents carefully, question charges, or negotiate terms. Some lenders rely on this moment to push loans that look manageable now but become stressful later.\n\nThat’s when a “saviour” starts to resemble a loan shark, not through illegal means, but through aggressive pricing and rigid recovery.\n\nRed flags you should never ignore\n\nIf the caller refuses to share details by email, pressures you to decide immediately, asks for upfront fees, or insists on unusual payment methods, walk away. Legitimate lenders do not need urgency to close a good loan.\n\nAnother warning sign is being asked to share sensitive information casually over the phone. PAN, Aadhaar, OTPs and banking details should never be handed over to someone who called you first.\n\nWhen borrowing does make sense\n\nThere are times when these offers can be useful. If the call comes from your existing bank, the rate is competitive, and the terms are clearly documented, apersonal loanor auto loan can be a practical solution.\n\nThe difference lies in control. You should feel like you’re choosing the loan, not being pushed into it.\n\nWhat to do before you say yes\n\nBefore agreeing to any loan offer, pause and compare. Check rates from at least two other lenders. Ask for the total repayment amount, not just the EMI. Look at foreclosure charges, late payment penalties and whether insurance is optional or compulsory.\n\nMost importantly, ask yourself whether the loan solves a problem or simply postpones it.\n\nFrequent loan calls aren’t inherently evil, but they are not acts of generosity either. They are sales pitches, designed to move fast and ask questions later.\n\nUsed carefully, a loan can smooth cash flow or help you acquire something meaningful. Used carelessly, the same loan can lock you into years of stress.\n\nWhen the phone rings with an “exclusive offer”, remember this: the power lies in how slowly and thoughtfully you respond.",
