But in reality, retirement doesn’t usually fall apart because of one bad calculation. It unravels slowly, because of a series of small, very human mistakes—many of them made by people who have actually saved diligently for decades.\n\nTalk to enough retirees and you’ll hear the same regret in different words: “I thought I had planned well enough.”\n\nHere are the traps that most often catch them.\n\nTreating retirement like a finish line, not a new phase\n\nA lot of people plan as if life somehow slows down and becomes cheaper the day they stop working. In practice, the opposite often happens—at least for the first 10 to 15 years.\n\nTravel plans, long-postponed hobbies, family visits, and better healthcare all cost money. Many retirees are surprised to discover that their expenses don’t fall much at all in the early years. Some even rise.\n\nIf your plan assumes that spending will drop sharply the moment your salary stops, you may find yourself tightening your belt far earlier than you expected.\n\nA more realistic approach is to think of retirement in phases: an active phase where spending stays high, a slower phase later, and finally a phase where medical costs dominate.\n\nUnderestimating how expensive healthcare becomes\n\nThis is the mistake that does the most damage. Medical inflation in India runs far ahead of general inflation. Even people with decent health insurance often discover that large expenses still come out of pocket—non-covered treatments, room rent limits, consumables, or repeated procedures.\n\nWhat looks like “good insurance” at 60 can start looking thin by 70.\n\nMany retirees also forget that health costs don’t rise in a smooth line. They come in lumps. One hospitalisation can wipe out years of careful budgeting.\n\nIf your retirement plan does not include a separate, growing medical buffer over and above insurance, it is fragile.\n\nBeing too conservative with investments too early\n\nThe moment people retire, many move almost everything into fixed deposits and “safe” instruments. It feels sensible. The salary has stopped. You don’t want volatility.\n\nBut retirement can easily last 25 to 30 years. If your money grows slower than inflation for that long, you are slowly but surely getting poorer.\n\nThe risk is not just market falls. The bigger risk is that your money does not grow enough.\n\nA portfolio that has no meaningful equity exposure in the early and middle years of retirement often runs out not because of one big crash, but because of years of silent erosion.\n\nDepending too much on property\n\nA house feels like security. A second house feels like a backup plan. Many people count real estate as their “retirement cushion”.\n\nThe problem is that property is illiquid, slow to sell, and unpredictable in price. It also does not help with monthly cash flow unless it is reliably rented.\n\nPlenty of retirees are “asset rich and cash poor”. They live in valuable homes but struggle to fund regular expenses without dipping into savings. Property can be part of a plan. It should not be the plan.\n\nAssuming children will always be the safety net\n\nNo one says this out loud, but many plans quietly rely on children “being there if needed”. Sometimes they are. Sometimes they are not—because of geography, their own financial pressures, or simple reality.\n\nEven when children are supportive, financial dependence changes relationships in ways people don’t anticipate. A healthy retirement plan is one that allows dignity and independence, not one that hopes for rescue.\n\nIgnoring inflation because it feels abstract\n\nA 6 percent inflation rate doesn’t sound dramatic. But over 20 years, it halves your purchasing power. Many retirees budget using today’s prices and make only vague adjustments for the future. The shock comes when the same grocery bill, the same helper, the same medical tests cost two or three times as much.\n\nInflation is not a line in an Excel sheet. It is the slow leak that sinks most retirement plans.\n\nWithdrawing without a strategy\n\nSome people spend freely in the early years and tighten later. Others become so frugal that they never really enjoy the money they saved.\n\nThe real danger is withdrawing blindly—taking out money without any structure, without thinking about which assets to sell first, and without planning for bad market years. A poor withdrawal strategy can damage a portfolio even if the investments themselves are good.\n\nThe quiet risk of living longer than planned\n\nLongevity is a blessing. Financially, it is also a risk. If your plan assumes life till 80 and you live to 92, that is 12 extra years your money has to work. This is not rare anymore. It is becoming normal.\n\nThe most dangerous retirement plans are the ones that work perfectly—right up to the year they don’t.\n\nThe real mistake: not reviewing the plan\n\nThe biggest error is not a bad decision at 60. It is failing to adjust at 45, 50, and 55. Retirement planning is not a one-time calculation. It is a living plan that needs to evolve with health, family, markets, and goals.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is this: most retirement disasters are not caused by laziness. They are caused by reasonable assumptions that quietly turn out to be wrong. The good news is that almost all of these mistakes are fixable—if you spot them early enough.\n\n1. How much money is actually “enough” for retirement?\n\nThere is no single right number because it depends on your lifestyle, city, health, and how long you might live. A useful starting point is to estimate your annual expenses in today’s terms and assume you will need a corpus that can support at least 25 to 30 years of spending after retirement, adjusted for inflation. The bigger mistake is not the exact number—it is failing to review and update it every few years.\n\n2. Is it risky to keep money in equity after retirement?\n\nIt can feel risky, but having zero or very little equity exposure is often riskier over a long retirement. Since your money may need to last 20-30 years, some growth assets are necessary to beat inflation. The key is not to take excessive risk, but to have a balanced portfolio and a sensible withdrawal plan so you are not forced to sell equity in a bad market year.\n\n3. Can health insurance alone take care of medical costs in retirement?\n\nUsually, no. Health insurance is essential, but it rarely covers everything. Room rent limits, co-payments, non-covered treatments, and repeated procedures can still create large out-of-pocket expenses. That is why a separate medical buffer fund is just as important as having insurance.",
