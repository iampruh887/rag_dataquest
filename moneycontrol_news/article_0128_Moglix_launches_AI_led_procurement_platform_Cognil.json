  "content": "Business-to-business (B2B) commerce unicorn Moglix, on January 1,4 announced the launch of Cognilix, an artificial intelligence (AI)-led operating system for enterprise procurement and B2B commerce, alongside a planned investment of $5 million to expand its AI products.\n\nThe platform formalises technology that Moglix has built and used internally over the past decade to run its procurement, supply chain and commerce operations. The company is positioning Cognilix as a software layer that works alongside existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, rather than as a standalone software-as-a-service (SaaS) pivot.\n\nWhat is Cognilix built on?Cognilix is built on Moglix’s operating footprint of more than $40 billion in procurement transactions, over 45,000 suppliers, 1.2 million stock keeping units (SKUs), operations across more than 80 countries and a network of 58 warehouses.\n\n“About 50–60 percent of the value had to be built inside Moglix first,” founder and chief executive Rahul Garg told Moneycontrol. “We are now externalising it because procurement globally still uses very little technology, and most software products don’t reflect how procurement teams actually work.”\n\nWhat does Cognilix do for enterprises?The platform enables enterprises to automate procurement workflows such as digital catalogues, request-for-quotation (RFQ) comparisons, supplier onboarding, compliance checks, competitive electronic auctions and inventory forecasting based on historical usage.It also supports structured B2B selling through digital storefronts with integrated order management, payments, logistics and real-time inventory visibility, while standardising enterprise data across procurement and supply chains.\n\nWho is already using Cognilix, and what are they seeing?According to Garg, more than 10 large enterprises are already using Cognilix as a standalone platform, while over 1,000 customers use one or more of its underlying modules through the broader Moglix ecosystem.Garg said early use cases include inventory reductions of up to 30% for some enterprises, as well as improvements in sales efficiency and total cost of ownership for large manufacturing customers.\n\nHow will Moglix make money from Cognilix?Cognilix will be offered as a white-labelled software stack and monetised primarily through software fees, with some customers opting for pricing linked to commerce volumes.\n\nWhat does this mean for Moglix’s broader business?The launch comes as Moglix sharpens its focus on improving operating leverage. In the financial year ended March 2025 (FY25), the company reported a 15 percent increase in revenue to around $700 million and nearly halved its losses. While Moglix has previously indicated interest in a public listing around 2027, Garg said discussions on timing remain premature as the company works through structural issues such as redomiciling from Singapore to India.",
