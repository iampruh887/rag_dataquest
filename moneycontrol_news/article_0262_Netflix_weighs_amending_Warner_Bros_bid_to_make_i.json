  "content": "Netflix Inc. is working on revised terms for its Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. acquisition and has discussed making an all-cash offer for the company’s studios and streaming businesses, people familiar with the discussions said.\n\nThe changes are designed to expedite a sale that will take months to close and has faced opposition both from politicians and rival bidder Paramount Skydance Corp. Institutional investors have been divided in their support.\n\nUnder the original agreement, Warner Bros. shareholders were to receive $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in Netflix common stock, with certain adjustments in place if shares of the streaming giant fall below $97.91. Since the company’s pursuit of Warner Bros. began in October, Netflix shares have lost about a quarter of their value. They traded as low as $89.07 Tuesday in New York.\n\nNetflix lined up $59 billion of financing from Wall Street banks to help support its acquisition, in the form of one of the largest ever bridgeloans.They’ve already refinanced about $25 billion of that with some longer-term debt.\n\nNetflix has the financial capacity to borrow more and still maintain its “robust” credit ratings, Stephen Flynn, a senior credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a research note on Tuesday.\n\n“Netflix has a very strong balance sheet with modest net leverage,” he said.\n\nAfter choosing Netflix in early December, Warner Bros. has faced repeated efforts by Paramount to scuttle that deal and accept its offer.\n\nParamount Chief Executive Officer David Ellison and his father, Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison, have launched a tender offer for Warner shares, extended a personal guarantee to $40.4 billion of funding and sued Warner Bros. for more details about their valuation of the Netflix transaction.\n\nThey also plan to nominate directors to the board to thwart the deal.\n\nWarner Bros. rose 1.6% to $28.86 at the close in New York following the news of Netflix’s deliberations. Shares of Netflix rose 1% to $90.32",
