  "content": "Bitcoin was trading above $95,903 at around 9.20 am on January 15, up 0.38 percent from the previous day. The world's largest cryptocurrency dipped to a low of $95,797 and a high of $97,735 in the morning session.\n\n\"Bitcoin hit fresh eight-week highs despite elevated US producer price inflation for November. Markets largely brushed off concerns that higher inflation could lead to tighter Federal Reserve policy, which would normally weigh on crypto and other risk assets. The rally was fuelled by a combination of favourable US inflation data, positive regulatory developments surrounding a crypto bill and positive net inflows in the spot ETFs. As a result, the global cryptocurrency market capitalisation now stands near  $3.25 trillion, reflecting renewed investor optimism,\" said Piyush Walke, derivatives research analyst, Delta Exchange.\n\nAccording to CoinSwitch Markets Desk, with limited resistance ahead and strong liquidity clustered near $100K, momentum favours further upside. The $95K is key support level, while a sustained break above $100K could turn psychological resistance into a springboard, accelerating price discovery and upside momentum.\n\nOther crypto tokens were volatile. ETH was down 1.62 percent, ADA 5.60 percent, XRP 4.08 percent and SOL 1.75 percent. Tether gained 0.03 percent in the past 24 hours.\n\n\"Dash continues to soar, leading the top gainers with over a 37 percent rise, followed by Internet Computer with a 26.05 percent jump. Besides, Story plunges heavily by over 25 percent, followed by Pepe by 9.17 percent and Canton by 8.11 percent,\" CoinDCX Research Team said.\n\nCheck out the cryptocurrency prices on January 15 at 9:20 am (IST).\n\nAccording to Avinash Shekhar, co-founder and CEO of Pi42, there's a renewed conviction in digital assets as bitcoin pushes above the $97,000-plus range and broad market participation returns. Bitcoin’s strength reflects growing demand as a non-sovereign store of value and improved macro conditions that are driving renewed capital flows into crypto assets.\n\n\"For investors today, a balanced approach makes sense: maintain core exposure to Bitcoin for its structural role in portfolios while scaling selective positions in Ethereum and strategic altcoins like XRP that are demonstrating relative strength and adoption. Staying aligned with on-chain signals and regulatory clarity will position investors to capitalise on this phase of market expansion,\" said Shekhar.\n\nWhat’s happening in the crypto market?\n\nHere’s a rundown of the crypto market, according to WazirX founder Nischal Shetty:",
