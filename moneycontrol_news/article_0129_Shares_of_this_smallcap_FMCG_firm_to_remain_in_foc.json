  "content": "Shares of smallcap packaged food company Krishival Foods are expected to be in focus on Friday after the company informed stock exchanges about the completion of its Rs 100 crore rights issue.\n\nThe BSE and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) were shut on Thursday due to municipal corporation elections in Maharashtra. Trading in equities, equity derivatives, securities lending and borrowing, currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives remained closed for the day on both exchanges.\n\nKrishival Foods had launched the rights issue to raise up to 9,999.48 lakh rupees. The issue involved the allotment of 33,33,160 new partly paid-up equity shares.\n\nThe entitlement ratio was fixed at 45 shares for every 301 fully paid-up equity shares held by shareholders on the record date. The rights issue opened on December 26, 2025, and closed on January 7, 2026.\n\n\"The Rights Issue Committee has approved the allotment of 33,33,160 partly paid-up equity shares of face value Rs 10 each on a rights basis,\" the company said in an exchange filing.\n\nShares of the company saw profit booking and settled lower at Rs 334 on the NSE in Wednesday's trade.\n\nMeanwhile, the equity benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty settled lower on Wednesday, extending their previous day's losses, due to weakness in IT, consumption, and select banking blue-chip stocks amid escalating geopolitical tensions. Besides, persistent foreign fund outflows and fresh tariff-related uncertainties also unnerved investors.\n\nThe Sensex dropped 244.98 points, or 0.29 percent, to settle at 83,382.71. During the day, it fell 442.49 points or 0.52 percent to 83,185.20. The Nifty declined 66.70 points, or 0.26 percent, to 25,665.60.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
