{"title": "Unacademy to exit company-run centres, pivot to franchise model after upGrad acquisition talks collapse", "content": "Edtech firm Unacademy will exit its company-operated offline centres and transition fully to a franchise-led model over the coming months, founder Gaurav Munjal told employees in an internal email, marking a significant shift in how the company runs its offline business.\n\nThe move comes weeks after months-long acquisition talks between Unacademy and upGrad fell through after the two sides failed to align on valuation and deal structure, as first reported by Moneycontrol. The collapse of the talks has left Unacademy to chart its next phase independently, even as it continues to restructure its business.\n\nWhat did Gaurav Munjal say in the internal email?\n\nIn the email, reviewed by Moneycontrol, Munjal told employees that Unacademy will exit its company-operated offline centres by converting them into franchise partnerships, a model where local operators run day-to-day centre operations, while Unacademy continues to provide academics, technology, curriculum and brand reach.\n\n“Over the coming months, we will exit our company operated centre business by converting them into franchise partnerships,” Munjal wrote, adding that the model had already shown it could work. He said the franchise structure allows Unacademy to remain asset-light and capital-efficient, while staying focused on what it does best — building scalable online learning products.\n\nAccording to the email, the transition is expected to be completed by April, after which Unacademy would no longer operate offline centres directly. Munjal said the shift would result in one of the healthiest cost structures in the sector, as local franchise partners take on operational responsibilities while Unacademy concentrates on academics, technology and product development.\n\n\"Unacademy has always been exceptional at one thing: building great online learning products. So we are going back to our strengths. Unacademy will be an online first company moving forth. Like it was when we started in 2015,\" a company spokesperson told Moneycontrol in response to queries.\n\nALSO READ:Uncertainty looms over Gaurav Munjal’s new startup as UpGrad calls off Unacademy deal\n\nHow has Unacademy’s cost structure changed?\n\nIn the note, Munjal detailed the extent of Unacademy’s cost reset over the past year. The company cut its test-prep burn from about Rs 450 crore in CY2024 to roughly Rs 200 crore, a shift he attributed to shutting down underperforming initiatives and doubling down on what was working.\n\nWhich Unacademy businesses have turned profitable?\n\nAccording to the email, several of Unacademy’s core verticals have turned contribution-margin positive. UPSC, NEET PG, CAT and multiple other test-prep businesses are now contribution-margin positive, while PrepLadder and Graphy were cash-flow positive for the full year. Language-learning platform Airlearn grew from around $200,000 in ARR at the start of 2025 to nearly $3 million by year-end, Munjal wrote.\n\nWhat leadership changes has Unacademy seen recently?\n\nThe announcement follows a period of leadership transition at the Bengaluru-based edtech firm. Earlier this year, Munjal and co-founder Roman Saini stepped back from operational roles, and Unacademy appointed co-founder Sumit Jain as chief executive of its core test-prep business.\n\nWhat is Unacademy’s current financial position?\n\nUnacademy currently has around Rs 1,100 crore in cash on its balance sheet, Moneycontrol had reported earlier, and the company is expected to decide its next course of action in the coming days as it completes the transition away from company-run centres.\n\nWhat does Munjal see ahead for Unacademy?\n\nIn the email, Munjal told employees that CY2026 would be about growth, not survival, after several years of cost correction and work on unit economics. “We know what we are good at.

{"title": "Retail inflation rises to 3-month high of 1.33% in December; economists split on February cut", "content": "India’s inflation firmed up in December, rising to a three-month high of 1.33 percent from 0.7 percent in November, government data released on January 12 showed.\n\nEven with the uptick, headline inflation has now stayed below the Reserve Bank of India’s lower tolerance threshold of 2 percent for four consecutive months, underlining how price pressures have cooled meaningfully since the middle of the year.\n\nFor the year as a whole, inflation averaged about 2.2 percent in 2025, making it one of the lowest readings seen in over a decade, helped largely by a sharp easing in food prices.\n\nDecember also marks a transition point for India’s inflation statistics. It is the final consumer price index (CPI) reading under the 2012 base year. Starting with the January print — due on February 12 — the CPI series will shift to a new 2024 base, with an updated consumption basket that includes more items and assigns a higher weight to non-food components.\n\nThe change is significant because the current CPI is heavily food-weighted, with food accounting for more than half of the index. This makes headline inflation highly volatile, as sharp swings in vegetables, cereals or pulses can move the overall number even when non-food prices remain stable.\n\nIn December, food deflation continued for a seventh consecutive month, as fall in the food index narrowed to -2.71 percent compared with -3.9 percent the previous month.\n\nThe decline was led by cereals, which fell into deflation of 0.5 percent for the first time in 51 months, while vegetables and pulses continued their deflation for 11 consecutive month.\n\nOils and fruits, on the other hand, were at a 15- and 16-month low, respectively.\n\nAt the same time, pockets of stickiness remain, particularly in personal care and services, which also account for gold and silver jewellery.\n\n“Core inflation (CPI excluding F&B, F&L, and petrol and diesel for vehicles) jumped to a 28-month high of 4.8 percent in December 2025 from 4.4 percent in November 2025. However, this was largely led by precious metals; core CPI excluding gold and silver remained unchanged at 2.4 percent between these months,” said Aditi Nayar, chief economist, ICRA.\n\nPersonal care inflation at 28% was at its highest level in series, even as other items like household goods and services, health and transport were at multi-year lows.\n\nA higher non-food weight in the rebased CPI is expected to make future inflation readings more reflective of broader demand conditions and less prone to food-driven spikes and collapses, though it could also make services-led inflation more visible.\n\nRBI policy implication\n\nWith headline inflation running well below target and core pressures easing, the data strengthen the RBI’s case for delivering another 25 bps rate cut in February meeting.\n\n\"We expect the next month’s final policy for FY26 to opt in for a 25bp cut in policy rates which may be the last easing in the current cycle by the MPC,\" said Paras Jasrai, associate director, Ind-Ra.\n\nHowever, not all agree. Economists contend that the central bank will likely wait for clarity from the rebased CPI and GDP series before recalibrating its medium-term inflation assessment.\n\n“While the December 2025 MPC minutes suggest a possibility of another rate cut in February 2026, ICRA believes that a pause is warranted at the current juncture. Besides, it would be prudent to wait and assess the updated CPI (base: 2024) and GDP (base: 2022-23) series, which are due to be released later in February, as these will determine the current growth-inflation mix and aid in forming a fresh outlook, said Nayar.\n\nEconomists contend that inflation is expected to move higher in coming months.\n\n“With the favourable base effect fading away, the retail inflation is expected to pick-up from 4QFY26 onwards. Ind-Ra expects the inflation to average 2.6% in 4QFY26 ,” said Jasrai.", "company": "", "date": "January 12, 2026/ 17:00 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Ishaan Gera"}

{"title": "Gold Bond alert: Over 4x returns on offer as SGB 2019–20 Series II opens for premature redemption today; check details", "content": "Investors holding Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) 2019–20 Series II can opt for premature redemption today, i.e. January 16, 2026, as Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced its early exit. The tranche completes five years from its date of issue which makes it eligible for premature redemption.\n\nAccording to Government of India notification dated May 30, 2019, premature redemption of SGBs is allowed after the fifth year from the date of issue, provided it falls on an interest payment date. The SGB 2019–20 Series II was issued on January 16, 2019, making January 16, 2026, the next eligible date for early exit.\n\nWhat is the redemption price for SGB 2019–20 Series II\n\nThe central bank has fixed the premature redemption price at Rs 14,092 per unit. The SGB 2020–21 Series IV was issued at a price of Rs 3,393 per unit.\n\nHow is the redemption price calculated\n\nThe price has been calculated based on the simple average of the closing price of gold of 999 purity for the previous three business days, as published by the India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA).\n\nAccordingly, gold prices for January 12, January 13, and January 14, 2026 were considered to arrive at the redemption value.\n\nThe redemption amount will be credited directly to the investor’s registered bank account.\n\nHow much did investors gain?\n\nThe premature redemption price of Rs 14,092 per unit reflects strong gains for investors who bought the SGB 2019–20 Series II at the time of issuance in July 2019. The bond was issued at an issue price of around Rs 3,393 per unit, meaning investors have seen a capital appreciation of nearly Rs 10,700 per unit, or over 315 percent, from gold price movement alone. In addition to this sharp rise in gold prices, investors also earned 2.5 percent annual interest, paid semi-annually, which further boosted overall returns during the holding period.\n\nFor example, an investor who invested Rs 1 lakh in this SGB tranche at the time of issue would receive over Rs 4.1 lakh on premature redemption, excluding the interest income earned over the years.\n\nHow premature redemption works\n\nSGBs have an 8-year tenure, but investors are allowed to exit early starting the 5th year—only on the dates when semi-annual interest is paid. Premature redemption must be initiated through the investor’s bank, post office, or agent from whom the bond was purchased, typically with a request submitted several days in advance.\n\nWhat is the Sovereign Gold Bonds scheme?\n\nSGB Scheme was introduced by the Indian government in November, 2025 as an alternative to attract gold ownership. The bonds were issued by the RBI for and on behalf of the Centre. The bonds denominated in grams of gold offered investors dual benefit-- earning a fixed annual interest of 2.5% on the issue price and earning capital appreciation linked to gold prices. The scheme majorly aimed to reduce India’s reliability on imported physical gold, curb hoarding, and channel household savings into financial assets.\n\nHow Do Sovereign Gold Bonds Work?\n\nIf you want to invest in Sovereign Gold Bonds, all you need is to purchase Sovereign Gold Bond from either a bank, SHCIL or designated post offices. For offline purchases, an SGB certificate from the holding of the issuing bank or designated post offices is issued. You can collect it. In case you have purchased an SGB online, your demat account portfolio will reflect. The SGBs offer an interest of 2.5% per annum.\n\nWhat is the tax treatment of Sovereign Gold Bonds\n\nAs per the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (Section 43 of 1961) the interest on the SGBs is taxable. When an individual redeems these bonds, they are free from paying capital gains tax. Any capital gains that result from the transfer of the bonds on the exchange will be eligible for the indexation benefits.", "company": "", "date": "January 16, 2026/ 13:28 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

As a pure OFS, the company will not receive any proceeds from the IPO, with the entire amount accruing to the selling shareholder.\n\nThe issue gathered momentum early in the bidding window, getting fully subscribed within about 25 minutes of opening on Day 1, before accelerating sharply on the final day as institutional and high-net-worth investors piled in.\n\nWhat investors are watching next: Strong GMP, positive brokerage views, listing cues\n\nAhead of listing, unlisted shares of Bharat Coking Coal were trading at a grey market premium of about 47 percent over the IPO price, with shares changing hands around Rs 33 apiece, according to data from Investorgain. Market observers said the rising GMP over the bidding period reflects strong expectations of a positive listing, though such unofficial indicators remain volatile.\n\nBrokerages have largely struck a constructive tone. Anand Rathi has advised investors to ‘subscribe’ to the issue for listing gains, citing the company’s strong market position and a valuation of about 8.6 times FY25 earnings at the upper end of the price band. Deven Choksey has also maintained a ‘Subscribe’ rating, recommending the IPO for long-term investors and pointing to a defensive yield profile with potential growth upside.\n\nThe broader narrative around value unlocking has also gained traction. Gaurav Garg, research analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk, has said the BCCL IPO goes beyond a routine listing and represents a strategy to unlock embedded value, with potential benefits for both the parent and the subsidiary over the long term.\n\nBharat Coking Coal listing date uncertainty\n\nThe IPO closes for subscription later today, January 13, with the allotment expected to be finalised on January 14. However, uncertainty has emerged over the listing timeline as domestic equity markets will remain shut on Thursday, January 15, due to municipal corporation elections in Maharashtra. The credit of shares to demat accounts and refunds were earlier scheduled for January 15, and a revised timetable is awaited.

Robust private consumption, aided by earlier tax reforms and improving real incomes—particularly in rural areas—has been a key driver of this upgrade.\n\n“In India, growth is estimated to increase to 7.2 percent in FY2025–26, mainly reflecting robust domestic demand, including strong private consumption, supported by earlier tax reforms and improvements in real household earnings in rural areas,” the report noted.\n\nFirst advance estimates released by the government last week pegged FY26 growth at 7.4 percent.\n\nLooking ahead, the World Bank expects growth to moderate slightly. For FY27, it projects expansion of about 6.6 percent, marginally lower than its earlier estimate of 6.7 percent. The medium-term outlook, however, remains constructive, with services activity expected to stay strong alongside a gradual recovery in exports and a pickup in investment.\n\n“Growth is set to inch up to 6.6 percent in FY2027–28, underpinned by robust services activity, as well as a recovery in exports and a pickup in investment,” the report said.\n\nGlobally, growth is expected to remain subdued. The World Bank forecasts world output to slow to 2.6 percent in 2026 from 2.7 percent in 2025. Emerging market and developing economies are projected to grow 4 percent, down from 4.2 percent, while advanced economies are expected to see growth ease to 1.6 percent.\n\nAmong major economies, the US is expected to grow slightly faster at 2.2 percent, up from an earlier estimate of 2.1 percent, while China’s growth is projected to slow to 4.4 percent from 4.9 percent.", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 20:00 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Ishaan Gera"}

But having an account on paper and being able to use it confidently are very different things.\n\nPassbooks often aren’t updated. Mobile numbers change. ATM cards go missing or are never used. Some workers don’t know how to check their balance without visiting the branch. Others are nervous about using machines or apps because one mistake feels risky.\n\nHelping someone link their mobile number, update KYC, or learn basic ATM use may seem trivial, but it quietly changes how they relate to money. Once the account actually works, other things — insurance, pensions, transfers — stop feeling out of reach.\n\nMoving wages to the bank, gently\n\nCash wages feel simple. But cash disappears quickly and leaves no trail.\n\nEven shifting part of the salary to a bank transfer creates a record. That record matters later — for proof of income, forloaneligibility, sometimes even for something as basic as renting a room or opening another account. It also reduces risk. Cash can be lost or stolen. Money in a bank account is safer.\n\nThis doesn’t have to be all or nothing. Some households start by transferring a fixed portion every month and keeping the rest in cash. The transition works best when it’s gradual and explained, not imposed.\n\nProtection first, not investments\n\nBefore anyone talks about investing, protection matters more.\n\nMost domestic workers are one illness or accident away from serious financial stress. Low-cost life and accident insurance schemes exist for exactly this reason. But enrolling someone isn’t enough. What really helps is sitting down and explaining, slowly, what the policy is for, when it pays out, and who receives the money.\n\nOtherwise, insurance becomes just another document tucked away and forgotten.\n\nHealth expenses are often the biggest shock. Even basic health cover, where affordable, can stop a medical issue from turning into years of debt. Again, understanding matters more than paperwork.\n\nSaving habits matter more than big amounts\n\nMany workers already save — just not formally. Money set aside at home. Informal savings groups. Cash kept with someone trusted.\n\nFormal savings work only if they don’t feel intimidating or restrictive. A small recurring deposit can be enough. The amount isn’t the point. The habit is.\n\nWhat helps most is letting the worker decide what feels comfortable. Pushing for higher amounts usually backfires. Consistency builds confidence far better than ambition.\n\nSIPs come much later, if at all\n\nMutual fund SIPs can be powerful, but they are not a starting point. They make sense only after banking, insurance and basic savings feel stable. And even then, expectations need to be clear from the start. Markets go up and down. Some months will look bad. SIPs are about time, not quick results.\n\nIf SIPs are introduced, helping with account opening, nominee details and reading statements once in a while can prevent fear and confusion later.\n\nThe overlooked step: Nominations and paperwork\n\nThis is where many people — across income levels — drop the ball.\n\nAccounts without nominees create chaos for families when something goes wrong. Helping domestic staff add nominees to bank accounts, insurance policies and savings instruments is one of the simplest, most useful things you can do.\n\nKeeping a basic list of where accounts exist and who to contact doesn’t feel urgent — until it suddenly is.\n\nUnderstanding beats enrolment, every time\n\nSigning someone up for a product they don’t understand isn’t empowerment. It’s just paperwork.\n\nWhat actually helps is explaining things in plain language, answering the same questions more than once, and encouraging people to say when they don’t understand. Financial confidence grows slowly, especially for those who’ve only seen money as something fragile.\n\nRespect comfort, pace and choice\n\nNot everyone will want help immediately. Some will hesitate. Others may say no altogether. That’s fine. Support works best when it’s offered, not pushed. The goal isn’t control or compliance. It’s independence.", "company": "", "date": "January 17, 2026/ 15:00 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}
{"title": "Chasing the cheapest home loan rate? Why crossing a credit score of 800 changes the game", "content": "Most homebuyers focus on property prices, down payments and EMIs. Fewer pay attention to the number that banks look at first. Your credit score. If it is comfortably above 800, you are not just another applicant. You are someone banks actively want on their books.\n\nThat matters more than people realise.\n\nWhy banks care so much about the 800 mark\n\nFor lenders, a borrower with an 800-plus score is predictable. They pay on time, they do not stretch themselves recklessly, and they usually do not need constant follow-ups. Internally, many banks classify such customers as low-risk even before looking at income or employer details.\n\nThis often shows up as a lower spread over the benchmark lending rate. Sometimes it shows up as faster approvals, fewer questions or even a willingness to match a competing bank’s offer. Over a long-tenure home loan, even a small interest rate difference can translate into several lakhs saved.\n\nThe credit card habit that quietly holds scores back\n\nA common frustration among salaried professionals is being stuck at 760 or 780 despite never missing a payment. In many cases, the issue is not late payments at all. It is credit card utilisation.\n\nUsing a large portion of your available limit month after month tells lenders that you lean heavily on credit, even if you clear the bill every time. To move toward 800, banks prefer to see that you are using credit sparingly, not squeezing it.\n\nKeeping card usage closer to a quarter of your total limit makes a visible difference over time. Some people achieve this simply by asking for a higher limit and not increasing spending.\n\nAt higher scores, small mistakes matter more\n\nOnce you are close to 800, there is very little room for sloppiness. A missed minimum due, a delayed buy-now-pay-later instalment or a forgotten subscription-linked payment can pull your score down quickly.\n\nThis is where boring systems help. Auto-debits, calendar reminders and keeping a small buffer in your account reduce the risk of an avoidable slip. Banks reward consistency, not occasional perfection.\n\nWhy closing old cards can backfire\n\nIt feels sensible to shut unused credit cards. But older accounts add depth to your credit history, which matters more as you aim for an excellent score.\n\nIf an old card has no annual fee and has been managed well, keeping it alive and lightly used strengthens your profile. From a lender’s perspective, it shows that good behaviour has been sustained over time, not recently adopted.\n\nYour loan mix sends signals too\n\nA credit report dominated by short-term, unsecuredloanscan raise eyebrows. Too many personal loans, app-based credit lines or frequent consumer loans suggest dependence on easy credit.\n\nOn the other hand, successfully running a longer-term secured loan shows discipline. It tells the bank you understand what a multi-year commitment looks like and can stick with it.\n\nTiming your credit activity matters\n\nMany borrowers damage their own score just months before applying for a home loan. Multiple credit card or loan applications leave enquiry trails. Too many in a short span can temporarily drag scores down.\n\nIf a home purchase is planned, it helps to stop all other credit applications at least six months in advance. Let your profile look calm and settled when the bank checks it.\n\nWhat to focus on just before applying\n\nIn the final months, the goal is simple. Do nothing that creates noise. Keep utilisation low, pay everything early, avoid restructuring loans and check your credit report carefully for errors.\n\nIncorrect loan statuses or wrongly reported delays are not rare. Getting them fixed before applying can improve your negotiating position.\n\nWhy patience usually pays off\n\nAn 800-plus credit score does not guarantee the lowest possible home loan rate. But it puts you in the best possible position to ask for it.\n\nIronically, the behaviour that gets you there is not dramatic. It is steady, repetitive and sometimes dull. From a bank’s point of view, that is exactly the kind of borrower they are happy to lend to for decades.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 14:09 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

Fancy jumping on the ‘Go-Green’ bandwagon? Well, electric vehicles (EVs) are definitely\n\t\t\t\t\tone way to go about it. EVs are no longer just a hope for the future, they are here right now and on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe cusp of a revolution. As is the case with anything new, the fear of the unknown is real. To\n\t\t\t\t\tallay those fears and help you make an informed decision, here is our comprehensive primer on EVs.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe technology, why it is better, challenges, global picture, and a journey through the history\n\t\t\t\t\tbooks—we have it all covered. It is everything you need to know about EVs.\n\nThere’s no engine oil to change, in fact no engine to maintain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat all. Also, fewer moving parts, no belt or chain to be serviced, no transmission fluid to be\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanged, no clogged-up valves or burnt clutch plate and no sweat over emission tests. So, what\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoes maintaining an EV entail?\n\nInput the values in the boxes with ‘*’ to calculate the running cost\n\t\t\t\tof an electric car as compared to a traditional car\n\nNumber should be greater than 0\n\nLocalised electric vehicle battery manufacturing may in fact be the only way to realise India’s EV market potential and help the government meet its target of 30% private EV sales by 2030. Currently, both EV batteries and cells are imported and account for about 40-50% of the EV’s total cost. Manufacturing the lithium-ion cells to make the batteries in India would make them cheaper, faster, and allow for large-scale manufacturing! In fact, even Tesla’s Elon Musk recently announced plans to halve battery costs through in-house battery cell engineering! Watch this episode of Drive Report to understand how manufacturing batteries in India will completely change the EV game!\n\nThe road to electrification has been long and bumpy.Contrary\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto popular belief, the electric car is not a recent invention and predates the internal\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcombustion car by nearly 50 years. Here’s a look at the rise, decline and revival of EVs.\n\nFirst motorised electric carriage is built. While the actual year\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis disputed, a Scotsman named Robert Anderson is credited with creating the first\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcrude electric vehicle while another Scotsman named Robert Davidson built a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprototype electric locomotive in 1837. Capable of towing 6 tons, it had\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnon-rechargeable batteries and a severely limited range of 3 km. Rechargeable ones\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twouldn’t be invented until 1859.\n\n‘Electrobat’, first commercial electric car comes out. Top Speed –\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t36kph | Range – 40km. It goes on to serve as a cab. US President Theodore Roosevelt\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecame the first president to take a ride in the car.\n\nBelgian builder Camille Jenatzy builds the first EV to break the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t100kph speed barrier.\n\nFerdinand Porsche builds the first hybrid electric car.\n\nFord Model T arrives and alters the course of history. It is the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfirst mass produced internal combustion car. Costs half as much as an EV and is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresistant to extreme heat and Detroit’s chilly winters. By 1912, costs about $300, a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfraction of EVs.\n\nFossil fuel powered cars completely outclasses EVs.\n\nBy the end of WWII, EV makers had either gone bust or converted to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfossil fuel.\n\nHenney Kilowatt is produced. Of the 100 produced, only 47 were\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsold.\n\nGeneral Motors comes out with Electrovair II. But its batteries\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcould only last 100 recharge cycles. A new pack at the time would cost $1,60,000. A\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLamborghini 350GT at the time would only cost $5,480.\n\nNASA’s Apollo 15 lunar mission required the use of a car/rover on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe moon. The Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) is produced. It is popularly called the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t‘Moon Buggy’.\n\nThe 70s fuel prices skyrocket due to an OPEC-imposed oil embargo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEVs were once again in focus and the Sebring-Vanguard Citicar and Comuta car became\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpopular. The latter became the largest electric car produced in the US; a record\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeaten by Tesla in 2013.\n\nChevrolet comes out with the Electrovette. But after fuel prices\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdipped, eVette’s low range, low speed and outdated battery tech led to its undoing.\n\nChetan Maini’s Reva Electric is set up.\n\nGM produces the EV1m the first mass-produced and purpose-designed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\telectric vehicle of the modern era.\n\nReva-I, also called G-Wiz in European markets is launched. It is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndia’s first production EV and the world’s first, truly affordable EV.s\n\nAfter failing to convince AC Propulsion to put its\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfast-accelerating prototype ‘Tzero’ into production, Martin Eberhard and Elon Musk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjoin forces and use the tech under license to form a little-known brand called Tesla\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMotors.\n\nTesla Roadster is launched. It becomes the first lithium-ion\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbattery powered production EV and the first EV to cover 320km on a single charge.\n\nEV startups like Rivian and Rimac are launched. Rimac goes on to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduce the Rimac One – the fastest production electric vehicle. Rimac Two hits\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0-100kph in 1.9 secs.\n\nTesla Model S revolutionises the EV market with its mix of space,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperformance and long-distance driving capabilities.\n\nChevrolet re-enters the EV market with Bolt. Tesla launches Model\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3.\n\nElon Musk debuts the Tesla Cybertruck concept.\n\nJaguar, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and BMW announce plans to go\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tall-electric by the end of the decade.\n\nToyota plans to launch EV featuring new technology called\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t‘solid-state batteries’ by 2024.\n\nElectricity was not readily accessible as it is today. Only few cities in the US had\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccess to electricity at the time. Hence, electric cars were not a viable option for many.\n\nEVs at the time were mostly used for short distances. As road infrastructure got\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetter, the need for long distance drives became a necessity which EVs at the time could not\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmeet.\n\nAfter the discovery of Texas crude oil, gasoline prices plummeted making it\n\t\t\t\t\t\taffordable to the average consumer. This led to cheaper operating costs.\n\nHenry Ford made car buying cheaper with the introduction of the Ford Model T which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcost a fraction of what EVs cost at the time. That, along with the invention of the electric\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstarter meant gasoline cars were easier to operate.\n\nFollowing the dip in oil price, gasoline cars started getting cheaper. By 1912, the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprice gap between gasoline cars and EV widened. Al electric roadster in 1912 sold for $1750\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhile a gasoline car cost just $650. Ford cars were also available in the $500 - $1000 range.\n\n2019 – 2030 Demand growth in the EV industry\n\nCopper, nickel and lithium are some of the key metals used\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin EV battery production\n\nThe demand for EVs is driving the demand for metals, with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmore and more manufacturers joining the EV bandwagon\n\nAccording to Wright’s Law, lithium-ion battery costs fall by 28%\n\t\t\t\t\tfor every cumulative doubling of units produced. The battery pack is the most expensive component of\n\t\t\t\t\tan EV. Thus, the sticker prices of EVs fall as battery costs decline. Some EVs are already cheaper\n\t\t\t\t\tto own and operate than comparable gasoline powered cars due to the cost saved from fuel,\n\t\t\t\t\tmaintenance, and resale value\n\nSensex TodayBharat Coking Coal Share PriceMumbai BMC Election ResultsMaharashtra Election ResultsInfosys Share PricePune Election ResultsOld Tax RegimeNobel Peace Prize medalGold PriceAmazon Great Republic Day Sale\n\nBusinessMarketsStocksIndia NewsCity NewsEconomyMutual FundsPersonal FinanceIPO NewsStartups\n\nHomeCurrenciesCommoditiesPre-MarketIPOGlobal MarketBonds\n\nHomeLoans up to 50 LakhsCredit Cards Lifetime FreeFinance TrackerNewFixed DepositsFixed Deposit ComparisonFixed Income\n\nHomeMC 30Top Ranked FundsETFsMutual Fund Screener\n\nIncome Tax CalculatorEMI CalculatorRetirement PlanningGratuity CalculatorPetrol Price in IndiaDiesel Price in IndiaIFSC Code\n\nNews18FirstpostCNBC TV18News18 HindiCricketnextOverdrive\n\nAbout UsContact UsAdvisory AlertAdvertise with UsSupportDisclaimerPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyTerms & ConditionsFinancial Terms (Glossary)SitemapInvestors\n\nCopyright © Network18 Media & Investments Limited.

{"title": "Aim to revise Stand-Up India for bigger loans, wider reach: DFS secretary", "content": "The government plans to revamp the Stand-Up India scheme to offer larger loans and widen its reach, Department of Financial Services (DFS) Secretary M Nagaraju said on January 13, as part of a broader push to deepen financial inclusion and back small entrepreneurs.\n\nSpeaking at the Global Inclusive Finance Summit, Nagaraju said the government is “trying to revise the Stand-Up India scheme” and wants to “provide largerloansto more people from the SC, ST beneficiaries”. He noted that women’s participation under the scheme is higher than men’s. “Even in the Stand-Up India scheme, women's participation is higher compared to men. In fact, among the SC, ST, the aspiration for women is higher compared to the men,” he said.\n\nSince April 2016, 2.75 lakh loans worth Rs 62,000 crore have been sanctioned under the scheme, according to data cited by Nagaraju. Stand-Up India is aimed at promoting entrepreneurship among women and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities by facilitating bank loans.\n\nUnder the current framework, banks can provide loans ranging from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 1 crore to eligible entrepreneurs from the Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, or women categories to set up greenfield enterprises in manufacturing, services, trading or allied sectors.\n\nFintech’s global access via trade deals\n\nIn a separate initiative, the DFS is working to help Indian fintech companies access overseas markets. Nagaraju said the department is “trying to provide fintechs access to the ecosystem through trade deals with other countries”.\n\nIndia, he said, is particularly focused on East Asia as it looks to expand UPI and the broader digital payments ecosystem abroad, while ensuring Indian firms are not shut out of global markets.\n\nBanking reach at 99.9%\n\nNagaraju said 99.9 percent of villages are now covered by banking touchpoints, with the remaining gaps in difficult terrain such as parts of Arunachal Pradesh.\n\n“We are trying to design some new things there. I hope by the end of this year, we will be having a touch point even in those remotest places within 5 kilometres,” he said, referring to a cluster-based approach for the Northeast.\n\nBanking correspondents, he added, have been central to the expansion. “Imagine 60 lakh BCs going around in the villages, mohallas, trying to bring people, first opening their accounts and then providing banking services,” he said.\n\nCleaning up accounts, tackling risks\n\nThe government has also launched drives to clean up the system. Nagaraju said a recent campaign weeded out inactive accounts and added more than 3 crore new accounts over the past three months. “Currently we have about 57 crores… accounts,” he said.\n\nGoing forward, he said financial inclusion must translate into financial literacy and then financial security, built on three pillars: “credit, risk coverage and pension”. He also flagged that micro-units need support to scale up, as “the graduation of micro-units into medium and large enterprises is actually not happening in the country”.\n\nFinancial inclusion as a growth engine\n\nNagaraju said financial inclusion has become a key driver of economic growth and poverty reduction. “Financial inclusion is a key driver of economic growth, poverty alleviation,” he said, adding that it has had a “multiplier effect on economic growth”.\n\nCalling the launch of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) on August 20, 2014, “one of the most transformative days in India’s history”, he said the programme has reshaped India’s financial landscape. “Now…….over 50 crore people have bank accounts in India. And most of them are poor, from the rural areas and marginalised sections,” he said.\n\nHe added that the gender gap in account ownership has almost closed, with women increasingly seeing themselves as “equal stakeholders in economic development of the family”.", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 13:39 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Meghna Mittal"}

{"title": "NPS for aggressive investors: Equity, lifecycle choices and new flexibility", "content": "The National Pension System has always been positioned as a steady, long-term retirement product rather than a high-octane wealth machine. But over the years, it has quietly become far more flexible — even for investors who are comfortable taking meaningful equity risk in pursuit of higher returns.\n\nIf you are in your 20s, 30s or even early 40s, and retirement is still decades away, NPS now allows you to structure your Tier-I portfolio in a way that looks far more growth-oriented than it did a decade ago. You still have to operate within regulatory guardrails, but within those, there is enough room to build a genuinely aggressive, equity-heavy strategy.\n\nEquity exposure: The engine of growth\n\nFor any aggressive NPS investor, everything starts with equity — known as Asset Class E inside the system. This is the portion of your money that is invested in Indian stocks and equity-related instruments, and it is the main driver of long-term growth.\n\nUnder current rules, Tier-I accounts allow you to allocate up to 75 percent of your contributions to equity. That is the highest permitted limit, and most growth-focused investors aim to stay close to it, especially in the early and middle parts of their careers.\n\nIf you are 30 years old with another 30 years to go before retirement, a 70-75 percent equity allocation inside NPS is not unusual. Over long periods, equities have historically beaten all other asset classes, and NPS is designed to let you participate in that — while still preventing you from going all-in.\n\nIf you want even more freedom, Tier-II accounts allow 100 percent equity allocation. But Tier-II comes without tax benefits or lock-in, so it should be treated as a voluntary investment account rather than your core retirement pillar.\n\nAuto choice and lifecycle investing\n\nNot everyone wants to rebalance their portfolio every year. That is where NPS’s Auto Choice options come in.\n\nThe Aggressive Auto Choice (often referred to as LC75) starts you off with high equity exposure when you are young — close to 75 percent — and then gradually reduces that exposure as you age. The idea is simple: take more risk when time is on your side, and slowly dial it down as retirement approaches.\n\nFor many investors, this “set it and forget it” approach is actually safer than trying to manage allocations manually. It ensures you don’t stay overexposed to equity when you are 55 or 60 and suddenly vulnerable to a bad market just before retirement.\n\nIf you enjoy managing your own asset mix, Active Choice gives you that control. But then the responsibility to reduce risk over time is entirely yours.\n\nWhy even aggressive investors need diversification\n\nBeing aggressive does not mean putting everything into equity and forgetting the rest.\n\nNPS allows you to split money across corporate bonds, government securities and even a small slice of alternative assets like REITs and infrastructure trusts. These components may not deliver explosive returns, but they play a crucial role when markets turn ugly.\n\nA portfolio that is 75 percent in equity and 25 percent in debt and government securities will usually fall less in bad years and recover more smoothly. That stability matters more than most people realise — especially as your corpus grows into a meaningful retirement sum.\n\nWhat’s changed in 2026\n\nOne of the biggest recent upgrades is the Multiple Scheme Framework for non-government subscribers. You can now invest in more than one scheme under the same PRAN, which makes it easier to fine-tune how new contributions are deployed.\n\nAt the same time, regulators have expanded lifecycle options, including variants that maintain higher equity exposure for longer. The direction of travel is clear: NPS is slowly becoming more customisable, even for investors with higher risk appetites.\n\nThe right way to think about aggressive NPS investing\n\nIf you are 25 or 30, an equity-heavy NPS strategy makes a lot of sense. If you are 45, you still can be aggressive — but with more balance. If you are 55, you probably should not be.\n\nNPS works best when it mirrors your real life stage, not your risk-taking mood.\n\nThe system gives you enough freedom to chase growth — but not enough to destroy your retirement through reckless positioning. That balance is its real strength.\n\n1. Can I put 100 percent of my NPS money in equity?\n\nNot in Tier-I. The equity cap there is 75%. In Tier-II, you can go up to 100%, but you lose tax benefits and retirement discipline.\n\n2. Is Auto Choice better than Active Choice for aggressive investors?\n\nAuto Choice is better if you don’t want to manage rebalancing yourself. Active Choice is fine if you are disciplined and review your asset mix regularly.\n\n3. What happens if markets crash close to my retirement?\n\nIf you are in Auto Choice, equity exposure will already be lower. If you are in Active Choice and stayed aggressive too long, you could be forced to sell at bad prices — which is why risk must be reduced with age.", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 19:31 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Edited by :Moneycontrol PF Team"}
{"title": "‘Graduation’ is the missing link in too much inclusive finance: CEA", "content": "Banks must stop treating successful micro borrowers as permanent beneficiaries of small-ticket loans and instead help them move into mainstream finance, Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran said, arguing that failure to enable this “graduation” weakens the very idea of inclusive finance.\n\n“Graduation is the missing link in too much inclusive finance. We are good at entry, but we are very poor at ascent. A person should not remain a micro borrower forever. If her business grows, her financial options should go with it,” he said at the Global Inclusive Finance Summit on February 13 in New Delhi.\n\nHe said mainstream banks cannot remain spectators while millions of small entrepreneurs prove their creditworthiness through microfinance and government-backed schemes.\n\n“The question now is whether the formal banking system is willing to recognise that reality and offer them overdrafts, MSMEloans,insurance and working capital lines, not as beneficiaries of a scheme, but as ordinary clients,” Nageswaran said.\n\nInclusion is not just about access\n\nNageswaran said inclusive finance is often judged by how many people are brought into the system, not by what happens to them afterwards.\n\n“We often speak of inclusion as though it were an end in itself. We count the number of bank accounts opened, the number of loans disbursed and the number of mobile wallets activated,” he said. “But inclusion, properly understood, is not a destination, it is a journey.”\n\nHe said the real test of inclusion is whether people become economically stronger.\n\n“The real question is not whether people have entered the financial system, but whether finance is helping them move towards economic independence,” he said.\n\nStreet vendors and PM SVANidhi\n\nNageswaran cited the experience of street vendors under the PM SVANidhi scheme to show how aligned credit can change livelihoods.\n\n“Street vendors were among the hardest hit during the lockdown when economic activity came to a halt. Their working capital disappeared overnight,” he said. “What the scheme did was simple. It restored liquidity.”\n\nHe said independent assessments show that many vendors have gone beyond recovery.\n\n“Vendors who entered the scheme did not merely recover. Many of them expanded, invested and strengthened their livelihoods in a sustained way,” he said.\n\nHe added that those who moved through multiple loan cycles grew faster than the broader economy.\n\n“Those who progressed through successive loan cycles have seen their business grow faster than even the economy around them,” he said.\n\n“These were credit-constrained entrepreneurs, not debt-trapped households,” he added.\n\nHealth shocks and social protection\n\nNageswaran said even well-designed credit cannot protect people from shocks.\n\n“One of the main reasons people fall behind on repayments is not laziness or irresponsibility, but unexpected events, especially health-related shocks,” he said.\n\nHe said inclusive finance must be supported by affordable healthcare, insurance and social security.\n\n“Without that, lenders face higher risk and borrowers face higher vulnerability,” he said.\n\nInvestors and responsible capital\n\nHe also spoke about the role of investors in inclusive finance.\n\n“Inclusive financial institutions are not ordinary commercial lenders,” he said. “They are intermediaries between capital markets and some of the most economically vulnerable yet entrepreneurial people in society.”\n\nHe warned against demanding high returns.\n\n“If capital insists on high returns, institutions will chase volumes and margins,” he said. “The result may look like inclusion in the short run, but it is extraction in the long run.”\n\nHe said true impact investing requires accepting lower financial returns in exchange for social impact.\n\nTimely payments matter most\n\nNageswaran said the most powerful inclusion tool is not a new loan.\n\n“The most powerful financial inclusion tool is not a loan, but a timely payment,” he said.\n\nHe said when governments and companies pay small suppliers on time, working capital stress falls sharply.\n\n“Fair contracts and prompt settlement do more for small enterprises than micro credit ever will,” he said.\n\nHe said inclusive finance must lead to independence.\n\n“The goal of inclusive finance is not merely to create more borrowers. It is to create more independent, productive and confident economic citizens,” Nageswaran said.\n\nGrowth strongest form of inclusion\n\nThe Chief Economic Adviser said economic growth itself is the most powerful driver of inclusion.\n\n“The first and most fundamental truth in this regard is that most economic growth itself is the strongest and most sustainable form of financial inclusion,” he said. “When an economy is generating jobs, incomes, markets and demand, people do not need to be forced into the financial system. They enter naturally.”\n\nHe added that finance cannot substitute for real livelihoods.\n\n“Finance is a complement to growth, not a replacement for it. Where livelihoods are stagnant, inclusion becomes fragile. Where livelihoods are expanding, inclusion becomes a self-reinforcing process,” he said.", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 21:40 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Meghna Mittal"}

Of the total units approved, 31,455 were residential, reflecting sustained end-user demand as well as investor confidence in Gurugram’s long-term housing fundamentals.\n\n“The residential mix was spread across categories, with 17,405 group housing units, 5,720 mixed land use units, 4,040 residential floor units, 2,122 affordable group housing units, 1,954 units under the Deen Dayal housing scheme, and 214 residential plotted colony units,” the Authority data showed.\n\nMarket observers said this diversified pipeline indicates that capital is being deployed across both premium and mass segments, reducing concentration risk and improving the depth of the market.\n\nAuthority officials said that of the 4,000 commercial units approved during the year, 168 units were dedicated to IT parks, reinforcing Gurugram’s status as a preferred destination for technology firms and Global Capability Centres.\n\nAnalysts said the combination of office-led employment growth and residential development continues to make Gurugram attractive for long-term capital deployment.\n\nIndustry experts said that the scale of investments approved in 2025 reflects Gurugram’s ability to attract capital even amid global uncertainty, driven by infrastructure expansion, strong corporate presence, and a more robust regulatory framework.\n\n“With a large pipeline of approved projects and continued interest from developers and institutional investors, Gurugram is expected to remain a key investment destination within India’s real estate market in the coming years,” a Gurugram-based real estate expert said.\n\nTighter regulatory checks\n\nAuthority officials said that alongside rising investment volumes, Gurugram RERA implemented tighter regulatory checks to improve transparency and protect investor and homebuyer interests.\n\n“These steps included enhanced scrutiny of developer submissions, mandatory site inspections by domain experts, and the introduction of public consultation through mandatory public notices before project registration,” an official said.\n\nAmlan Dutta, VP Sales and Strategy, Trehan Iris, said, that Gurugram’s clearance of 131 projects in 2025 marks a remarkable momentum for the sector, reflecting strong investor confidence and a renewed sense of market optimism.\n\n“RERA’s transparent and well-structured framework has played a pivotal role in driving this growth by empowering developers with greater planning certainty, smoother access to capital and the confidence to deliver high-quality projects on time. By promoting accountability and minimizing ambiguity, RERA safeguards buyer interests while simultaneously enhancing developer credibility,” he said.\n\nSudeep Bhatt, Director Strategy, Whiteland Corporation, said that regulatory reforms under RERA have been a key stimulus, bringing in greater transparency through strict compliance norms, mandatory site inspections and continuous project monitoring.\n\n“This has strengthened trust among HNIs and NRIs, leading to growing NRI participation and rising Indian global clout in real estate investments,” he said.", "company": "", "date": "January 16, 2026/ 18:33 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Ashish Mishra"}

{"title": "Daily Voice | Two factors to drive equities this year; Budget focus on consumption, capex: Ashwini Shami", "content": "According to Ashwini Shami, President and Chief Portfolio Manager at OmniScience Capital, current geopolitical factors are largely factored into existing market levels.\n\nHe said in an interview with Moneycontrol that the outlook for the year will primarily be determined by two factors: the continued impact of various fiscal and monetary stimulus measures on corporate earnings, and the relative underperformance of Indian markets compared with global peers.\n\nRegarding the Union Budget, Shami expects the government to maintain strong allocations for capital expenditure and to announce incremental measures to support consumption.\n\nDo you expect geopolitical tensions to remain in the news this year and cap the market’s upside?\n\nThe current geopolitical factors are broadly factored into the current market levels. The two factors that will broadly determine the outlook for this year will be - the continued impact of various fiscal and monetary stimulus on the corporate earnings and the relative underperformance of Indian markets compared to the global peers.\n\nThe time correction over the last one year and the improving growth rate for the Indian economy at 7-8% is likely to attract foreign flows. While there are pockets of significant overvaluations, we expect the fresh flows from both domestic and international investors to help reprice undervalued sectors such as banking, power, engineering & construction and business services.\n\nSo, even though the broader market has come to the more reasonable valuations, there are significantly better opportunities for bottom-up, stock specific alpha-hunting scientific investors.\n\nWhat could be the biggest reform in Union Budget 2026 that would decisively lay a strong foundation for equity markets?\n\nUnion budget for the last many years has been growth focused allocating significantly to capital expenditures while being exceptionally conservative on the revenue expenditures and at the same time improving the fiscal deficit numbers year on year.\n\nThe last year’s budget also focussed aggressively on boosting consumption through tax cuts. We expect the government to maintain the same trajectory of strong allocations on the capital expenditure and also announce incremental measures to support consumption.\n\nDo you expect PSUs to be star performers this year?\n\nExecution of orderbooks / work-in-progress projects shall continue to remain the key drivers of earnings growth and stock performance. For the undervalued names from financial services, housing finance, power and infrastructure one could also expect significant rerating resulting in even stronger stock performance.\n\nAre you super bullish on BFSI after several years of underperformance in the sector?\n\nBanking sector while being one of the most undervalued sectors has already witnessed significant unlocking over the last one year. While the Nifty 50 over the last one year delivered around 10% returns, Nifty Bank index is up nearly 22%. On the valuation front, Nifty 50 is at 22 price to earnings multiple whereas the bank index trades at 16 times earnings.\n\nWe expect this performance divergence to continue this year as market reprices public sector and private sector mid/smallcap banks and other financial services companies including pure play housing finance firms and infrastructure NBFCs.\n\nDo you think 2026 will be challenging for the markets until earnings recover to mid-teen growth?\n\nWe believe with the relative valuation narrowing between India and other emerging markets and the economic growth rate improvement from 5.6% to 8.2% over the last one year, the case for FII inflows is becoming stronger. The expectation of a couple of additional rate cuts from the US Fed in view of softening labour market also supports the case for money moving to higher-yielding emerging markets.\n\nWe expect the upcoming budget to focus on boosting consumption further while sufficiently investing in the growth assets which we believe will support the overall economic growth in 2026 and also take markets higher.\n\nDo you think the risk-reward ratio for gold and silver is unfavourable at current levels?\n\nPrecious metals have had a strong year triggered by the trend of de-dollarization and money moving to other currencies, including precious metals. The exceptional steep rise itself is indicative of exceptional price volatility and should caution investors who are allocating significantly to gold and silver. The price volatility seen in the lithium prices over the last 5 years is a good reminder of the price risk when prices go beyond the fundamentals.\n\nBased on Q3 earnings announced so far, are you convinced that the earnings recovery is continuing and that Q4 numbers will be stronger?\n\nWhile only a limited number of companies have reported their earnings so far, the overall trend looks positive for the undervalued sectors, especially in financial services where both private and public sector mid-cap banks have reported strong earnings growth and improving asset quality.\n\nIT also reported better-than-expected numbers. We expect the fiscal and monetary initiatives to start reflecting in the Q3 earnings and expect Q4 also to exhibit strong earnings growth.", "company": "", "date": "January 17, 2026/ 06:57 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar"}

Treating them as the same can lead to wrong expectations and disappointment at the exit stage.\n\nGratuity is about how long you stayed\n\nGratuity exists to reward long service. If you complete the minimum required years of continuous employment, the employer is required to pay it. This applies whether you resign, retire, or are terminated, unless the exit is for serious misconduct.\n\nOnce eligibility is met, the employer doesn’t have much choice. The amount follows a set formula. That’s why gratuity is relatively predictable.\n\nSeverance is about how you lost the job\n\nSeverance is usually paid when the employer initiates the exit. Layoffs, redundancy, restructuring, or shutdowns are typical situations where severance comes into play.\n\nIf you resign on your own, severance is usually not offered. Even in layoffs, severance depends on company policy or what’s written in your contract. Some companies are generous. Some are not. Some negotiate. Some don’t.\n\nThere is no universal rule.\n\nWho controls the payout matters\n\nGratuity is governed by law. Severance is governed by internal policy or contract terms.\n\nThat difference changes everything. With gratuity, disputes are usually about calculation. With severance, disputes are often about entitlement itself.\n\nTwo employees leaving the same organisation can receive very different severance outcomes, even with similar tenure.\n\nThe tax impact surprises many people\n\nGratuity enjoys tax exemptions up to prescribed limits when paid as per law. For many employees, this makes a big difference to what they actually receive.\n\nSeverance pay is usually taxed as salary or compensation. The number may look large on paper, but tax can take a noticeable bite.\n\nThis is why gratuity often feels more meaningful in hand than severance of a similar amount.\n\nWhy one is easier to fight for\n\nIf gratuity is delayed or denied, employees have clear legal remedies. Authorities treat such cases seriously.\n\nSeverance is harder to challenge. If it’s discretionary or vaguely worded in policy, employees may have little leverage. This is why severance often becomes a negotiation point, while gratuity usually does not.\n\nThe mistake people make while planning exits\n\nMany employees assume severance will automatically be paid. They plan expenses around it. That’s risky.\n\nGratuity, if you’re eligible, is far more dependable. Severance should be treated as conditional unless it’s clearly guaranteed in writing.\n\nKnowing this difference early helps avoid stress when you’re already dealing with a job transition.", "company": "", "date": "January 18, 2026/ 13:01 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

Expenses can easily turn into a hefty amount, placing a huge financial burden on families.\n\nAs a result, many look for a loan for marriage to cover the soaring expenses. But this raises an important question: is it wise to opt for a marriage loan in India?\n\nA marriage loan, also known as a wedding loan, is a type of personal loan designed to help people finance wedding-related expenses. As it is an unsecured loan, you don't have to offer any collateral.\n\nThe marriage loan can be used for various purposes such as venue booking, buying jewellery and clothes, hiring makeup artists and photographers, or arranging decor.\n\nMoneycontrol has teamed up with 8 trusted lenders to offerpersonal loans of up to Rs 50 lakh.

A steady income is crucial to ensure timely EMI payments, which in turn can also help in a good credit score.\n\nIt is also wiser to opt for a marriage loan instead of dipping into emergency funds or retirement funds, just for a one-time celebration, as borrowing a large amount of loan just to host an exquisite wedding can backfire.\n\nHowever, you need to make a decision cautiously if you already have existing loans or limited repayment capacity. This can lead to another financial obligation and can stretch your budget, leading to long-term stress.\n\nInterest rates for marriage loans\n\nSeveral banks provide loans for marriage and each bank has its own set of interest rates and repayment tenure.\n\n1.HDFC Bank:You can get a loan anywhere between Rs 50,000 and Rs 40 lakh with a flexible repayment tenure of 1 to 5 years.

The repayment tenure is flexible, which ranges between 1 and 6 years.\n\n4.Kotak Bank:You can get a loan of a minimum Rs 50,000 and a maximum of Rs 40 lakh. The interest ranges from 10.99% to 25%. It has a flexible repayment tenure, which starts from 1 month to 6 years.\n\n5.Bandhan Bank:With this bank, you can get a loan between Rs 50,000 and Rs 25 lakh. The interest rate starts at 9.47% if you have taken the loan for more than 3 years and if the loan is up to 3 years, then the interest rate starts at 12.15%.\n\nCompare offers from top lenders\n\nLoans for marriage: Eligibility\n\n1. Age must be between 21 and 60 years.\n\n2. Must have had a job for at least 2 years, with a minimum of 1 year with the current employer.\n\n3. You must have a minimum income as described by the lender.\n\nLoans for marriage: Documents required\n\n1. Identity proof and address proof such as Aadhaar Card, PAN Card or Voter ID Card.\n\n2. Bank statements for the last three months.\n\nGetpersonal loans of up to Rs 50 lakheasily through Moneycontrol's trusted partnership with eight leading lenders. The entire process is 100% digital and you just need to select your preferred EMI plan, fill in your details and complete a quick online KYC. With interest rates starting as low as 10.5%, securing a loan is now quicker and more convenient than ever.\n\nLoans for marriage: How to apply\n\n1. Go to the lender's official website and check if you meet the eligibility criteria.\n\n2. Compare interest rate, repayment terms, loan tenure, processing fees and other terms and conditions of various banks.\n\n3. Choose the lender as per your financial requirement.\n\n4.

Once the verification is approved, the loan amount will be disbursed into your bank account within 24 to 72 hours.\n\nTo conclude, it is okay to take a loan for marriage if you plan your finances smartly and wisely. You should not just borrow to show off or host a lavish wedding; instead, make sure it doesn't become a financial burden in the long run.\n\nExploreTop Lenders for Instant Loan upto\n\nFibe(EarlySalary Services Pvt.

In such situations, having quick access to funds becomes essential. That’s where an emergency personal loan in India can help. These loans provide fast financial support without the need to offer any collateral, making them a practical option when time is limited and paperwork needs to be minimal.\n\nWhat Is An Emergency Personal Loan?\n\nAn Emergency Personal Loan is an unsecured loan that helps people manage urgent expenses. Unlike traditional loans, which may take days to process, these loans are tailored for speed. Thanks to digital lending platforms and emergency personal loan apps, borrowers can apply, get approved and receive funds directly in their bank accounts within hours.\n\nThese loans usually require minimal documentation and are available to both salaried individuals and self-employed professionals. Whether you’re looking to cover hospital bills, pay rent or handle any sudden crisis, this type of loan is one of the most accessible financial tools available.\n\nMoneycontrol offers a convenient solution through its app and website, allowing borrowers to explore and compare instant personal loan offers from eight leading lenders. With a fully digital application process, approvals and disbursal can happen in just minutes.Loan amounts go up to Rs 50 lakh, with interest rates starting at 10.5% per annum — ideal for handling anything from medical emergencies to significant one-time expenses.\n\n• Application:Most emergency personal loan apps in India offer a completely digital application process that takes just a few minutes. You'll be asked to provide basic details such as your PAN, Aadhaar, income proof and bank information.\n\n• Verification:Lenders use automated systems to verify your documents. Some even evaluate alternative data, such as your spending habits or UPI activity, to speed up eligibility checks. This step can often be completed in real time or within a few hours.\n\n• Approval & disbursal:Once approved, the money is usually disbursed within an hour or by the end of the same business day. Some apps even claim to deliver funds within five minutes of approval.\n\nWhy Quick Approval Is Important\n\nThe defining feature of any emergency personal loan is speed. When you’re dealing with life’s urgent demands, waiting days for a loan to be approved just isn’t an option. Quick disbursal can be a game-changer in the following situations:\n\n• Medical treatment:For emergency surgeries or sudden health issues when insurance doesn’t cover everything.\n\n• Vehicle breakdowns:To pay for immediate repairs so you can get back to work or family duties.\n\n• Home damage:For fixing burst pipes, electrical faults, or other urgent maintenance.\n\n•Family emergencies:To cover last-minute travel, funeral costs, or unexpected support needs.\n\n• Temporary cash shortfall:If you’re between jobs or facing delayed salary payments.\n\n• Emergency personal loans:This is the most common form of emergency loan.

But interest rates are usually higher, especially for cash withdrawals.\n\nFind best loan options up to Rs,50 lakhs\n\nHow To Choose The Right Emergency Personal Loan\n\n• Speed of disbursal:Go for platforms or apps that specialise in emergency personal loans, as they offer faster approvals and payouts.\n\n• Interest rate:Rates usually range from 12% to 24% per annum. Compare multiple lenders to find the most affordable offer.\n\n• Repayment flexibility:Choose a loan tenure that aligns with your monthly cash flow. Most loans offer tenures between six months and five years.\n\n• Eligibility:Most lenders require a stable income, a decent credit score (650 or above), and Indian citizenship. Emergency Personal Loan Apps may also cater to new-to-credit users with alternate eligibility checks.\n\n• Transparent charges:Always check for processing fees, late penalties, and foreclosure clauses. A reputable lender will offer full transparency with no hidden costs.\n\nIf you’re looking for a quick loan without the hassle of paperwork, Moneycontrol’s app and website lets you browse offers from eight trusted lenders in one place. The process is completely online and often lightning-fast — some users get approvals and funds in mere minutes.

{"title": "ULIP, traditional plan or SIP? Why parents should separate insurance from child investment goals", "content": "Confused between ULIPs and traditional insurance plans for your child’s future? Today's Ask Wallet Wise query decodes before choosing either, it’s crucial to understand why mixing insurance with investments can hurt both returns and protection and what a smarter strategy looks like.\n\nI am a salaried employee working in the private sector and am interested in saving for my eight-year-old child. I am confused between ULIPs and traditional insurance plans. Please guide me.\n\nExpert's Advice:Please understand the most important principle of investing: never mix protection and investment needs while selecting a product. If you buy an insurance product as an investment, you neither get adequate life cover nor satisfactory returns in the long run. You should buy a pure term plan for life cover and invest separately in equity schemes of a good mutual fund house.\n\nThough ULIPs are sold as investment products rather than insurance products, they have various ongoing charges that reduce overall returns. Moreover, ULIPs suffer from liquidity issues, as you cannot access the money before completing five years, even if you surrender the policy earlier.\n\nTraditional life insurance plans also do not offer good returns. Historically, they have delivered around 5–6 percent, which does not even beat inflation. Hence, neither option is advisable. As a thumb rule, buy life insurance cover equal to 10–12 times your annual income through a term plan, preferably online.\n\nInvest the surplus in a mix of 80 percent equity mutual funds, 10 percent PPF, and 10 percent gold funds. It is also advisable to decide in advance the corpus you want for your child at a specific age and invest accordingly through monthly SIPs. You may start with passive funds like index funds and gradually move to active funds once you gain confidence.\n\nDisclaimer:The views expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

{"title": "'It’s a very big risk for India': Ajay Bagga warns India–US trade limbo could cost jobs in these sectors", "content": "Renowned market expert Ajay Bagga on Monday warned that the India-US trade deal is unlikely to materialise in the near term, flagging rising risks for India’s export-linked jobs and services sector, even as the Centre pushed back against speculation over delays in the talks.\n\n“I don’t foresee a trade deal. They’re making an example out of India,” Bagga told NDTV Profit in an exclusive interaction, saying he saw no urgency from the US side to conclude the agreement.\n\nCentre rejects speculation on delay\n\nThe remarks come a day after Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal urged confidence in India’s negotiating position, following the Ministry of External Affairs’ rejection of claims that the deal stalled because Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not call US President Donald Trump.\n\nResponding to comments by US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick that talks with India failed while Washington moved ahead with other countries, Goyal said: “Trust your country, your motherland, not foreign statements.”\n\nJob losses and second-order effects\n\nBagga warned that the absence of a trade deal could trigger second-order effects across labour-intensive sectors.\n\n“It is a very big risk for India,” he said, adding that job losses could emerge in textiles, gems and jewellery, and leather. He flagged a larger risk to India’s services exports, which account for a significant share of the country’s external earnings.\n\nCause and effect: A prolonged stalemate - continued tariff pressure and uncertainty - weaker export competitiveness - employment stress in key sectors.\n\nTariffs linked to geopolitics\n\nBagga said the 25 percent excess punitive tariff on India could be rolled back only under specific geopolitical conditions.\n\n“The 25 percent excess tariff could be removed if there is a Russia–Ukraine peace deal,” he said, suggesting trade outcomes are increasingly tied to global political settlements rather than bilateral economics.\n\nCall for a stopgap arrangement\n\nEven if a comprehensive pact remains elusive, Bagga said India should push for an interim solution.\n\n“India needs to conclude some kind of a transient agreement, even if a trade deal doesn’t happen,” he told NDTV Profit, while expressing doubts over any movement given what he described as a “very aggressive Trump administration” following the Venezuelan crisis.\n\nFed investigation raises market concerns\n\nBagga also criticised the criminal investigation involving US Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell, calling it a “huge disappointment.”\n\n“It’s a criminal investigation against a sitting central bank governor,” Bagga said, adding that Powell’s description of it as a political decision was deeply concerning.\n\nIn a formal statement, Powell said the threat of criminal charges stemmed from the Fed setting interest rates based on economic assessments rather than presidential preferences, warning of risks to monetary policy independence.\n\nMarkets and geopolitics in focus\n\nBagga said markets would closely watch the fallout, particularly in bonds. “Last time, around liberation day tariffs, bonds getting unstuck was how markets showed disappointment,” he said.\n\nHe also flagged rising geopolitical risk, saying US action against Iran appeared imminent, though not immediate. Iran, he said, is a well-armed, Russian-supported regime where regime change via aerial strikes would be unlikely.", "company": "", "date": "January 12, 2026/ 13:23 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol News"}

{"title": "Banking Central | Has bank recapitalisation run its course?", "content": "For nearly ten years, public sector bank recapitalisation has been one of the Union government’s most consequential policy choices. It did not make headlines the way loan waivers or tax cuts did, but it quietly kept the banking system afloat at a time when stressed assets threatened to choke credit and confidence.\n\nAhead of the 2026 Budget, the question is no longer about how much capital PSBs need, but whether the era of routine recapitalisation should finally close.\n\nBetween 2015-16 and the early 2020s, the government injected more than Rs 3 lakh crore into public sector banks. The turning point came in 2017, when recapitalisation bonds were deployed on a large scale to shore up capital without blowing a hole in the fiscal deficit. The objective was straightforward: allow banks to recognise badloanshonestly, meet regulatory capital norms and continue lending to a slowing economy.\n\nThat objective was largely met. Asset quality improved, capital adequacy ratios stabilised and the wave of bank mergers helped consolidate weak balance sheets. By the time the pandemic hit, PSBs were in a far stronger position than they had been just a few years earlier. Post-Covid, profitability improved sharply, helped by lower NPAs, better recoveries and a benign credit cycle.\n\nThis is why recent budgets have quietly stepped back from large capital allocations for banks. Capital infusion has shifted from being a fiscal necessity to a conditional option. The message from North Block has been clear: public banks are expected to fund growth through internal accruals and market borrowing, not repeated calls on the taxpayer.\n\nBudget 2026 will test how firmly that line holds. Credit demand is rising, infrastructure financing needs are large, and PSBs still dominate lending to priority sectors. Yet fiscal constraints are tighter, and there is little appetite for writing fresh recapitalisation cheques unless the system shows visible stress.\n\nThe lesson of the past decade is not that recapitalisation was excessive. It was necessary. But necessity cannot become habit. If PSBs, after years of public support and reform, still require routine capital from the budget, then the problem is no longer capital — it is governance.\n\nBudget 2026 should treat recapitalisation as an emergency tool, not a standing provision. After ten years of support, public banks must prove they can grow, compete and manage risk without leaning on public money.", "company": "", "date": "January 19, 2026/ 07:28 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Dinesh Unnikrishnan"}

This move aims to enhance the security of retirement income for subscribers.\n\nThe committee will be chaired by M. S. Sahoo, Founder of Dr. Sahoo Regulatory Chambers and former Chairperson of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI).\n\nThe 15-member panel includes a diverse group of experts from various disciplines such as legal, actuarial, finance, insurance, capital markets and academia.\n\nFurthermore, to ensure comprehensive deliberation, the committee has been authorized to invite external experts or intermediaries as special invitees for feedback and consultation.\n\nAccording to the Finance Ministry, the committee is established as a standing advisory committee on structured pension payouts. Its primary mandate includes creating regulations for assured payouts, ensuring a smooth end-to-end transition for subscribers moving from the accumulation phase to the decumulation (payout) phase, deliberating on novation and settlement concepts to ensure legally enforceable and market-based guarantees, and manage subscriber expectations regarding the nature of assurance and market based guarantee.\n\nThe committee will also be tasked with managing subscriber expectations by clearly defining what constitutes an “assured” payout versus a market-linked return, a distinction that has often caused confusion among NPS subscribers.\n\nAdditionally, the ministry has directed the group to design critical operational standards--including lock-in periods, fee structures, and withdrawal limits--while maintaining rigorous risk and legal oversight regarding capital and solvency requirements. To protect citizens, the framework will mandate standardized disclosures to prevent mis-selling and ensure transparent management of subscriber expectations for their post-retirement years.\n\nCurrently, NPS subscribers are required to use part of their accumulated corpus to purchase annuities from insurance companies at retirement, while the remaining amount can be withdrawn as a lump sum. However, annuity returns have often been modest and sensitive to interest rate cycles, leading to uncertainty around monthly pension income.", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 17:44 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Curated by :Manisha Lal Khandpur"}
{"title": "Chartist Talk: Direction for Nifty 50 remains uncertain but Sudeep Shah bets on these top 5 stocks for next week", "content": "The 20-day EMA continues to slope lower, while the 50-day and 100-day EMAs are largely flat, underscoring the lack of strong directional conviction. Momentum indicators echo this uncertainty, said Sudeep Shah, the Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities in an interview to Moneycontrol.\n\nHe believes the current price structure supports the possibility of a significant breakout in the Nifty IT index in the near term.\n\nSudeep Shah is betting onHCL Technologies, andPunjab National Bankfor next week. Further, he maintains bullish view onAU Small Finance Bank,Federal BankandBank of Indiaremains intact, supported by both sectoral and stock-specific technical strength.\n\nDo you expect the Nifty 50 to break out of its consolidation on the upside?\n\nAfter posting a fresh all-time high of 26,373 on January 5, the Nifty has entered a corrective phase. Importantly, the decline has been arrested near the 100-day EMA — a key technical support that has held steadily for the past five trading sessions. The index is now hovering around this zone, suggesting consolidation rather than any signs of panic-driven selling.\n\nOn the weekly chart, Nifty has printed a Doji candle, reflecting growing indecision among market participants amid the ongoing Q3 earnings season. The key question now is whether this consolidation is simply a pause before the next move, or a precursor to a deeper correction.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the short-term trend remains subdued. The 20-day EMA continues to slope lower, while the 50-day and 100-day EMAs are largely flat, underscoring the lack of strong directional conviction. Momentum indicators echo this uncertainty, with the daily RSI trapped in a narrow range of 38.55–42.84 for five consecutive sessions — a clear sign of subdued momentum and a cautious, wait-and-watch stance among traders. Historically, such extended compression in momentum tends to precede a sharp directional breakout, though the direction remains uncertain at this stage.\n\nGoing forward, Q3 earnings from index heavyweights are likely to act as the primary catalyst for Nifty’s next directional move. On the upside, the 25,900–25,950 zone near the 20-day EMA will be an important resistance area; a sustained breakout above 25,950 could trigger a quick rebound towards 26,200, with 26,500 as the next short-term objective. Conversely, the 25,500–25,450 band remains a crucial support zone, and a decisive breakdown below 25,450 could open the door for a sharper phase of correction.\n\nGiven the improvement in momentum and technical indicators, do you see the Bank Nifty hitting a fresh record high next week?\n\nBank Nifty extended its streak of outperformance versus the frontline indices for another week. While the broader market remained largely flat, the banking index gained 1.42%, further strengthening its relative leadership. On the weekly timeframe, the index has formed a bullish candle with a small lower shadow, suggesting that buying interest continues to emerge on declines.\n\nThe Bank Nifty–Nifty ratio has moved to a 132-week high, clearly reflecting a phase of sustained outperformance. Structurally, the trend remains firmly positive, with the index trading comfortably above its key moving averages. Momentum indicators also remain supportive, as the daily RSI is holding above the 60 mark and continues to trend higher.\n\nLooking ahead, the Q3 earnings announcements of key heavyweights HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank over the weekend are likely to act as important triggers and could shape the next leg of movement in the index.\n\nFrom a levels perspective, the 60,400–60,500 zone is expected to act as a crucial resistance area. A convincing close above 60,500 could open the door for a swift move toward 61,200, with further upside potential toward 62,000 in the near term. On the downside, immediate support is placed in the 59,300–59,400 band.\n\nDo you see the formation of a cup-and-handle pattern in Nifty IT on the daily chart? If so, does it indicate a potential significant breakout in the near term?\n\nYes, a cup and handle–like pattern is clearly visible on the daily chart of the Nifty IT index. The current price structure supports the possibility of a significant breakout in the near term. The index is trading comfortably above its key moving averages, indicating sustained strength, and the daily RSI is on the verge of crossing above the 60 level, which typically reflects improving momentum. Together, these factors reinforce the likelihood of an upside breakout in the near term.\n\nWhat are your top two stock picks for next week?\n\nHCL Technologies has delivered a downward-sloping trendline breakout on the daily chart, signalling a potential trend reversal. The stock found strong support near the confluence of its 50-day and 200-day EMAs on January 5 and has been steadily moving higher since then. Momentum indicators remain supportive, with RSI trending upward. Additionally, DI+ crossing above DI- on ADX suggests strengthening bullish strength.\n\nThe ratio line in Nifty IT/Nifty ratio has also broken above its previous high, indicating possible outperformance ahead, with the stock poised to lead the rally. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,700-1,690 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,630. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 1,850 in the short term.\n\nPNB has delivered a horizontal trendline resistance breakout on the daily chart, backed by a healthy rise in volumes. The Rs 127.5–128.5 zone, which earlier acted as a strong supply area, has now been decisively surpassed. Notably, the stock has closed above the upper Bollinger Band for two consecutive sessions, signalling strong momentum and aggressive buying interest, often seen in the early phase of a trending move.\n\nADX is steadily rising, indicating strengthening bullish trend strength. Additionally, the Nifty PSU Bank/Nifty ratio continues to move sharply higher, highlighting clear relative outperformance within the PSU banking space Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 133-132 with a stop-loss of Rs 127. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 145 in the short term.\n\nAre you maintaining a bullish view on AU Small Finance Bank, Federal Bank and Bank of India?\n\nYes, the bullish view on AU Small Finance Bank, Federal Bank and Bank of India remains intact, supported by both sectoral and stock-specific technical strength.\n\nBoth private banks and PSU banks are clearly outperforming the benchmark, as reflected by fresh breakouts and rising ratio line on their respective ratio charts versus the Nifty, indicating sustained relative strength.\n\nBank of India has witnessed a horizontal trendline breakout on the daily chart, backed by a rise in volumes. The stock is trading above its key moving averages, while the MACD remains above both the signal line and the zero line, confirming positive momentum. The price action and indicator setup suggest scope for continuation of the ongoing upmove.", "company": "", "date": "January 18, 2026/ 07:01 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar"}
{"title": "Real estate stocks fall for 7th straight day: Analysts say D-Street is factoring in a likely slump due to IT layoffs", "content": "The shares of real estate companies dropped in trade on January 14, recording a decline for the seventh consecutive session. Analysts have collectively highlighted how sustained IT layoffs may continue to impact the sector, and what lies ahead.\n\nThe sharp fall in the share prices pushed theNifty Realty indexdown around 1.7 percent to hit a near nine-month low of 843.60 in the morning trading hours of Wednesday. The sectoral index fell a combined 8% in the last seven trading sessions.\n\nTop realty losers today:\n\nSignatureglobal (India) shares dropped over 2 percent, whilePrestige Estatesshares fell around 2 percent.Macrotech Developers(Lodha), Brigade Enterprises and Phoenix Mills shares fell more than 1 percent each on January 14.\n\nAnant Raj andGodrej Propertiesshares fell around 1 percent each, while Sobha shares were down in the red with marginal losses. Bucking the trend, Oberoi Realty andDLFshares were trading in the green with marginal gains.\n\nAre IT layoffs behind the downturn?\n\nIndian IT sector has seen mass layoffs last year, which have now spilled over to this year. In July last year,Moneycontrolexclusively reported that the IT behemoth Tata Consultancy Services will be letting go of 2 percent of its workforce, or roughly over 12,000 employees, over 2026, in a bid to become more agile and future-ready amid rapid disruptions in technology.\n\nIndia’s largest IT services company on January 12 said that it has released 6,000 employees in Q2, and around 1,800 employees in December quarter.\n\nHCLTech, which also released its Q3 results on January 12, reported a net reduction of 261 employees during the quarter, taking its total employee base to 2,26,379 at the end of the December. However, the company didn't mention how many of these employees voluntarily exited and how many were laid off.\n\nAccording to analysts, the IT layoffs have impacted housing demand in key areas, thereby impacting the stocks. IT layoffs are likely to be the major reason for the low demand in the luxury segment of urban centers like Bangalore and Hyderabad as they will be discouraging the high-income buyers, said Shashank Gupta, Director, RPS Group.\n\nHe added that mid-to-premium housing sales, which have already dropped 15 percent year-on-year, will continue to be affected negatively as the professionals will not be willing to upgrade, opting instead to rent amid such job uncertainties.\n\n\"The market has whispered to the executives with Nifty Realty down by 20% from the peaks and talking about the disruption posed by the AI, which also indicates that 30% of the IT jobs that are luxury demand would get stifled due to the automation by 2027. The stock corrections that are expected to be around 5-7% are dependent on the RBI rate cuts and policy revamps that could fuel the market by the second quarter of 2026,\" the analyst said.\n\nKeshav Mangla, GM Business Development at Forteasia Realty, cited Anarock data to explain that financial tech layoffs of more than 1 lakh since 2024 have already resulted in a 12 percent drop in the demand for Tier-1 cities, thus resulting in developers' difficulties in managing cash flows and having to sell off their inventory.\n\n'A double-edged sword for real estate stocks':\n\n\"The stock market does not seem to be giving enough attention to the AI threat; the tools for generative AI are expected to take away 20-25% of the coding jobs which can bring down the HNI investments that are responsible for 30% of luxury property launches,\" Mangla said.\n\nThe continuous IT layoffs, which are expected to reach 2,00,000 by FY27, are a double-edged sword for real estate stocks which are currently at multi-month lows, said Anurag Goel, Director, Goel Ganga Developments. He explained that this was because the IT layoffs will cause a further reduction in purchasing power in the markets relying mostly on IT where 35 percent of homeloansare taken out.\n\nWhat is in store for the future?\n\n\"The lowest ever prices for Brigade and Sobha indicate the investors' fears about the prolonged sales stagnation, as the number of launches in Q3 2025 has declined by 18%. The stock market is taking into account the AI risks only to a certain extent since companies like Infosys that are hyperscalers are moving towards automating and thus, displacing the mid-level talent and consequently, the demand for flats costing Rs 10 lakh-Rs 30 lakh is being affected,\" Goel said.\n\n\"A slight hopefulness,\" said Goel while speaking about what lies ahead. However, he expects the real estate stocks to decline by another 8 to 10 percent more in the absence of a stimulus.\n\nIs there a silver lining?\n\nWhile headlines around IT layoffs and AI-led efficiency gains have raised concerns, the market is already discounting a slowdown in incremental office demand rather than a collapse, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head, INVasset PMS.\n\n\"AI is more a productivity lever than a demand destroyer at this stage. It may change how space is used, but it does not eliminate the need for physical offices, especially in collaborative and client-facing roles,\" Dasani explained.\n\nHe added that residential demand remains supported by stable employment outside pure tech, improving balance sheets, and low speculative supply. \"Near-term consolidation is possible, but structurally, the sector is adjusting—not breaking,\" the analyst said.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 12:39 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Debaroti Adhikary"}

{"title": "Trading Plan: Can Nifty 50 decisively break the 25,600-25,900 range, Bank Nifty sustain above 59,500?", "content": "The Nifty 50 continued to trade in a tight range of 300 points on a closing basis for the last four sessions, with mixed-to-bearish signals from technical and momentum indicators. According to experts, the index needs to break either 25,600 (around the 100-day EMA) for a downside move toward 25,450 (immediate key support) or 25,900 (50-day EMA) for an upward journey toward 26,000, as above it the 26,200â€“26,300 zone can be a possible target. Meanwhile, as long as the Bank Nifty holds 59,500 on a closing basis, the chances of a move beyond 59,800â€“60,000 are high; however, below it, 59,300â€“59,000 are the levels to watch.\n\nOn January 14, the Nifty 50 slipped 67 points to 25,666, while the Bank Nifty rose 1.35 points to 59,580. Market breadth was marginally in favour of bears. A total of 1,498 shares declined against 1,385 advancing shares on the NSE.\n\nNifty Outlook and Strategy\n\nSudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities\n\nThe benchmark index Nifty marked a fresh all-time high of 26,373 on January 5, but since then it has entered a corrective phase. This decline found support near the 100-day EMA, a crucial technical level that has held firm over the past four sessions. Currently, the index is oscillating around this zone, reflecting a phase of consolidation. The weekly chart suggests indecision among market participants, as bulls and bears struggle for dominance.\n\nAdding to this picture of uncertainty, Wednesdayâ€™s session saw the index move within a narrow range of 188 points, the tightest range in the last four trading days. This price action resulted in the formation of an NR4 (Narrow Range 4) pattern on the daily chart, often considered a precursor to a potential breakout in either direction. Technically, the 20-day EMA continues to slope downward, while the 50-day and 100-day EMAs remain flat, indicating a lack of clear trend strength. Momentum indicators echo this indecisiveness, with the daily RSI fluctuating between 38.55 and 42.84 for four consecutive sessions, suggesting muted momentum and a wait-and-watch approach by traders.\n\nGoing forward, the Nifty is approaching a critical juncture where price action could dictate the next directional move. On the downside, the 25,500â€“25,450 zone will act as a key support area, and any breach below this level could accelerate selling pressure. Conversely, on the upside, the 50-day EMA zone of 25,880â€“25,900 will serve as an immediate hurdle for the index. A decisive breakout on either side of this range is likely to pave the way for a trending move, setting the tone for the short-term market trajectory. Traders should closely monitor these levels, as they hold the potential to trigger significant volatility.\n\nKey Resistance: 25,880, 25,900\n\nKey Support: 25,500, 25,450\n\nStrategy: Buy Nifty Futures around 25,670â€“25,750, with a stop-loss of 25,600, targeting 25,960.\n\nNilesh Jain, Head â€“ Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst (Equity Research) at Centrum Broking\n\nThe Nifty index remained under selling pressure for the second straight session and formed a doji-like candle on the daily chart, signalling indecision among market participants. This price action suggests that the index may continue to trade in a range and extend the consolidation in the short term.\n\nOn the downside, immediate support is placed near the 100-DMA at 25,560, followed by the 25,470 level. On the upside, the 21-DMA around 25,990 continues to act as a strong resistance, and a decisive breakout above this zone is essential for any sustained short-term upside momentum.\n\nFrom an indicator perspective, the MACD has registered a bearish crossover on both daily and weekly charts, pointing to underlying weakness despite the possibility of a brief pullback. The broader trend remains fragile as long as the index stays below the 26,000 mark. Additionally, India VIX has been trending higher, hinting at a potential rise in near-term volatility, which could pose a mild headwind for the market.\n\nGiven the overall technical structure, a decisive breakdown below 25,650 in Nifty Futures could accelerate selling pressure and lead to a corrective decline toward the 25,400 level. Therefore, a sell-on-breakdown strategy is recommended below 25,650 in Nifty Futures.\n\nKey Resistance: 25,790, 25,990\n\nKey Support: 25,560, 25,470\n\nStrategy: Sell Nifty Futures below 25,650, with a stop-loss of 25,780, targeting 25,400.\n\nRupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities\n\nThe Nifty remained volatile during the day and traded with a bearish bias for most of the session on Wednesday. On the hourly chart, the index failed to move above the 20 EMA, indicating a prevailing weak trend. Additionally, the bearish crossover between the 21 EMA and the 50 EMA on the hourly chart remains intact, reinforcing negative sentiment.\n\nThe daily RSI has witnessed a breakdown from an upward consolidation, confirming a meaningful shift in momentum. In the short term, sentiment is likely to remain weak, with the potential for further downside. Support is placed at 25,600, below which a deeper correction may unfold. On the higher end, resistance is placed at 25,835.\n\nKey Resistance: 25,835, 26,000\n\nKey Support: 25,600, 25,500\n\nStrategy: Buy Nifty 25,600 PE of January 20 expiry around Rs 75, with a stop-loss of Rs 48, targeting Rs 120.\n\nBank Nifty - Outlook and Positioning\n\nSudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities\n\nThe banking benchmark index, Bank Nifty, has been consistently outperforming the frontline indices over the past few sessions, reflecting strong sectoral momentum. Currently, the index is trading above all its crucial moving averages, signalling a well-established uptrend. In contrast, the Nifty is still positioned below its 20-day and 50-day EMA levels, highlighting relative weakness in the broader market. A key technical observation is that the Bank Nifty-to-Nifty ratio chart has surged to a 609-day high and continues to rise, underscoring the strong outperformance of banking stocks compared to the benchmark index.\n\nLooking ahead, the zone of 60,000â€“60,100 will act as a critical resistance for Bank Nifty. A decisive and sustained breakout above 60,100 could trigger a sharp upside move, potentially driving the index towards 60,600, followed by 61,000 in the short term.

The maiden public issue of the company has been subscribed more than 30 times its offer size on Day 3 so far, amid a sharp surge in investor interest seen during the last few hours.\n\nThe initial public offering of the company received bids for nearly 82.40 crore shares, as against an offer size of 2.73 crore shares, according to data on NSE. Retail Individual Investors (RII) subscribed their reserved portion 9.31 times (931 percent).\n\nNon Institutional Investors (NII) however led the subscription numbers, subscribing their reserved portion nearly 37.36 times (3,736 percent). Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) have booked the portion kept for them 33.77 times (3,377 percent).\n\nAmagi Media Labs IPO GMP:\n\nAhead of listing, the unlisted shares of Amagi Media Labs were trading with a grey market premium (GMP) of 7.20 percent over the IPO price, according to data on Investorgain. The GMP quoted by the site has fallen over the days.\n\nAccording to IPO Watch, the unlisted shares of the company were trading with 7.48 percent GMP over the IPO price.\n\nAbout Amagi Media Labs IPO:\n\nAmagi Media Labs launched its initial public offering (IPO) to raise Rs 1,789 crore through a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 816 crore and an offer for sale worth Rs 973 crore by the existing investors. The price band for the IPO was set at Rs 343-361 per share.\n\nInvestors could bid for a minimum of 41 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,801 at the upper price band, and in multiples thereafter. The IPO was open for public bidding from January 13 to January 16. The allotments will likely be finalized by January 19, and the shares are scheduled to be listed on stock exchanges on January 21.\n\nAmagi Media Labs IPO Anchor Book:\n\nA day before the IPO opened for public bidding, Amagi Media Labs raised Rs 804.87 crore from 42anchor investorson January 12. Out of the total allocation to anchor investors, 1.69 crore equity shares worth Rs 613 crore were allocated to 11 domestic mutual funds including SBI Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, HDFC AMC, Motilal Oswal AMC, Franklin India, PGIM India, and Helios.\n\nInsurance companies like HDFC Life Insurance, Bharti Axa Life Insurance, and Edelweiss Life Insurance also picked up 14.95 lakh shares in Amagi for Rs 53.98 crore.\n\nAnand Rathi advised investors tosubscribe to the issueof the long term. Founded in 2008, Amagi Media Labs are a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company that connects media companies to their audiences through cloud-native technology, the brokerage noted. It added that the company’s platform helps content providers and distributors upload and deliver video over the internet (commonly known as streaming) through smart televisions, smartphones, and applications, instead of traditional cable or set-top box services.\n\nThey also help monetize such content through targeted advertising services for advertisers. Their technology has enabled the streaming of marquee events such as the 2024 Paris Olympics, Union of European Football Association (“UEFA”) football tournaments, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Awards (commonly known as the ‘Oscars’), and the 2024 U.S. Presidential debates.\n\n“At the upper price band, the company is valued at 6.7x FY25 P/S, translating into a post-issue market capitalisation of ₹78,098 million. It has turned profitable in H1 FY26 and, supported by strong operating leverage, is well positioned to deliver full-year profitability in FY26. Continued investments in R&D to enhance scalability, automation, performance, and user experience further reinforce its positioning as the “industry cloud” for video in the media and entertainment space. In light of these factors, the IPO appears fully priced,” Anand Rathi concluded.\n\nAmagi Media Labs represents a very different proposition from most recent Indian IPOs, being a technology-led, SaaS-oriented business with meaningful global exposure, said Prasenjit Paul, Equity Research Analyst & Fund Manager of 129 Wealth Fund. He added that the company operates in a scalable segment driven by programmatic digital advertising and cloud-based media services, which benefit from the ongoing shift of advertising budgets away from traditional television to data-driven and connected-TV platforms. \"That gives it long-term growth potential, but also means performance will be driven by execution, client retention and platform economics rather than near-term earnings,\" he said.\n\n\"The issue pricing appears more grounded compared to earlier private-market valuations, which improves the risk-reward for investors willing to look beyond short-term volatility. However, as with most technology IPOs, valuation sensitivity and the path to sustained profitability remain key considerations, especially in a global advertising cycle that can be uneven. In the current market environment, IPO participation needs to be selective and aligned with individual risk profiles. Capital-intensive, cash-generating businesses and growth-oriented technology companies like Amagi should be evaluated very differently. For investors who already have a stable core portfolio, this IPO can work as a selective growth allocation with a longer-term horizon, rather than a one-size-fits-all or listing-day trade,\" the analyst said.\n\nFollow allIPO newshere.", "company": "", "date": "January 16, 2026/ 17:25 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Debaroti Adhikary"}

{"title": "FIRE Explained: Lean, Coast and Barista strategies for early retirement", "content": "For many investors, the FIRE movement, Financial Independence, Retire Early, sounds like the perfect escape plan, especially freedom from the 9-to-5 grind. Save aggressively, invest smartly, and break free from work decades ahead of schedule. But once real-life expenses, family responsibilities, and rising costs enter the picture, the classic FIRE formula often feels difficult to follow.\n\nThis is where flexibility becomes important. Instead of forcing a rigid retirement rule, alternatives like Lean FIRE, Coast FIRE, and Barista FIRE, are emerging as more practical alternatives, especially for investors who want financial independence without extreme sacrifice.\n\nUnderstanding the Traditional FIRE Model\n\nThe FIRE retirement strategy rests on three pillars- saving 50-70 percent of income, living a frugal lifestyle, and investing wisely, usually through low-cost index funds.\n\nThe logic is straightforward. You drastically raise your savings rate by cutting expenses, then invest that surplus in diversified, low-cost funds so compounding works in your favour. Index funds matter here because they reduce the risk of costly investment mistakes and high fees eating into long-term returns.\n\nBut before any of this works, one key question needs answering: how much money do you actually need to retire early?\n\nMost FIRE followers rely on the Rule of 25. This rule says your retirement corpus should be at least 25 times your first-year post-retirement expenses.\n\nIn simple terms, if you need Rs 12 lakh a year after retirement (Rs 1 lakh a month), your target corpus becomes (12 lakh x 25) Rs 3 crore.\n\nThis is the well-known 4 percent withdrawal rule. If you withdraw 4 percent annually from a Rs 3 crore corpus, you generate Rs 12 lakh in the first year, with the rest remaining invested. Over time, withdrawals are adjusted for inflation.\n\nHowever,the FIRE frameworkthat suggests saving 25 times annual expenses often falls short in India.\n\nThis is because the assumption of low inflation does not hold true in the Indian context. Lifestyle costs, housing, and healthcare expenses typically rise by 6-9 percent annually, eating into the retirement corpus faster than investors expect. Under these conditions, the retirement corpus can run out much earlier.\n\nAlternatively, investors can aim for a higher safety buffer. For instance, instead of saving 25 times annual expenses, one may consider targeting 35 or even 40 times annual expenses.\n\nBased on this calculation, the required retirement corpus rises to Rs 4.2 crore at 35 times annual expenses (Rs 12 lakh × 35) and further to Rs 4.8 crore at 40 times annual expenses (Rs 12 lakh × 40), compared to Rs 3 crore under the 25X rule. This higher buffer helps absorb inflation shocks, prolonged weak market phases, and rising healthcare costs, reducing the risk of running out of retirement savings.\n\nWhen Traditional FIRE Becomes a Pain Point\n\nThere’s an important catch - saving 50-70 percent of income is not easy when you’re managing EMIs, family responsibilities, children’s education, and rising living costs.\n\nAs these rules are based on long-term US stock and bond market data, applying them blindly to Indian conditions, where inflation, healthcare costs, and market behaviour differ, can make FIRE harder to execute than it appears on paper.\n\nThis is where FIRE variations step in, not to reject the idea of financial independence, but to reshape it into something more achievable.\n\nVariations of F.I.R.E\n\nLean FIRE: Retiring With Lower Expenses\n\nLean FIRE focuses on one clear lever, reducing post-retirement expenses. Say, if your current annual spending is Rs 12 lakh, Lean FIRE pushes you to consider whether you can retire on Rs 10 lakh, Rs 8 lakh, or even less. That directly lowers the corpus you need.\n\nFor instance, if you consider post-retirement expenses as Rs 8 lakh per year, then your required corpus (Rule of 25) comes down to Rs 2 crore.\n\nWhen can this work? This approach is tough. Inflation pushes expenses up, and medical costs tend to rise with age. But some costs, office commute, work clothing, frequent dining out, may fall after retirement.\n\nThomas Stephen, Director & Head Preferred, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers says, “This method probably suits those individuals who are very clear about having a minimalist lifestyle for their entire lives. Therefore, to achieve financial independence here would require a much smaller corpus. Freedom of time is the main priority here.”\n\nCoast FIRE: Save Early, Then Slow Down\n\nCoast FIRE takes a very different approach. Instead of trying to fully retire early, you front-load your savings. In this case you save aggressively in your 20s and 30s, then shift to a lower-stress job later, one that covers day-to-day expenses while your accumulated corpus continues to grow untouched.\n\nLet’s understand with an example; Sunil, a 25-year-old investor with annual expenses of Rs 12 lakh; he invests Rs 30,000 a month through SIPs, increases the investment by 15 percent every year, and earns an expected return of 12 percent per annum.\n\nBy age 40, the investor accumulates a corpus of around Rs 3.5 crore. At this stage, he switches to a less demanding job that pays enough to meet household expenses. The original corpus remains invested.\n\nBy age 60, that Rs 3.5 crore grows to approximately Rs 23.5 crore, purely through compounding. At this point, he can fully retire, with the corpus supporting expenses well into later life.\n\nWhen this can work? Industry experts say the key discipline here is not touching the corpus for big-ticket expenses like cars, homes, or luxury travel. Any withdrawal breaks the compounding engine. “The basic idea here is to go on full throttle on one’s investments early on until the returns earned by the portfolio alone is good enough to reach the desired retirement corpus amount. At this inflection point, where portfolio returns will suffice future growth, the individual will stop further retirement contributions,” explains Stephen.\n\nCoast FIRE works well for investors who can save aggressively early and value work-life balance over chasing peak salaries forever.\n\nBarista FIRE: Don’t Quit Work Completely\n\nBarista FIRE is the most flexible of all. The idea is simple: don’t stop working entirely.\n\nInstead, you earn supplemental income through part-time work, freelancing, consulting, or teaching. This income covers part of your expenses, reducing how much you withdraw from your retirement corpus.\n\nTake Sunil’s case. If his post-retirement annual expenses are Rs 12 lakh, earning Rs 30,000 - Rs 40,000 a month through part-time work adds up to Rs 3.6- Rs 4.8 lakh a year. This means he needs to withdraw only Rs 7.2 - Rs 8.4 lakh annually from his retirement corpus, instead of the full Rs 12 lakh. Lower withdrawals help the corpus last longer and reduce stress during market downturns.\n\nThe key is choosing meaningful work, something you enjoy and can sustain. Otherwise, early retirement may not feel fulfilling. Stephen adds, “This would benefit someone who does not prefer the pressures of full time employment but enjoys working or seeks fulfillment through organizational structure.”\n\nThe biggest takeaway is this: FIRE is not one-size-fits-all.\n\nInstead of chasing a rigid rule, investors should:\n\n·       Be realistic about expenses and inflation\n\n·       Choose a FIRE variant that fits their lifestyle and career stage\n\n·       Focus on disciplined investing through low-cost, diversified funds\n\n·       Avoid withdrawing from long-term investments prematurely\n\nFinancial independence is not about quitting work at any cost. It’s about building options. Experts say, depending on the individual, these versions of FIRE allow greater flexibility and practicality, with the aim of “Living Freely” rather than “Retiring Early” taking precedence.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 08:01 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Priyadarshini Maji"}

{"title": "Rising Chinese imports may trigger more trade curbs in India: S&P Global", "content": "China’s exports to emerging Asia markets, including India and other southeast Asian countries is likely to face stiff resistance over both domestic and international pressures, a report by S&P Global Ratings said on January 14.\n\nThe report said the Chinese exports to emerging Asian economies have risen in the last few years, affecting domestic markets and the global economic landscape. According to the report, several Asian countries re-export Chinese goods to other nations, including the US. In several cases, domestic companies often struggle to compete with cheaper Chinese goods. In addition, the US has imposed stiff tariff on countries that are re-routing Chinese goods. Based on these factors, the report said the shipments from the world’s second largest economy is unlikely to grow as fast as it did recently.\n\nPressure on Indian manufacturing\n\nFor India, rising Chinese imports are putting domestic manufacturing firms under pressure and therefore could lead to more protective measures, the report said.\n\n“India has in recent years already introduced several measures to slow imports from China (and other sources). Steps include “safeguarding duties\" such as a December 2025 tariff on certain steel products,” the report said.\n\nHowever, India is not alone in taking such steps against Chinese goods. Several southeast Asian nations have imposed anti-dumping duties on Chinese steel. Indonesia has forced upon auch duties on several other products as well, while many others have brought in a custom duty on low-value parcels with tightened inspection protocols, according to the report.\n\n“These international responses are likely to limit the extent to which China's exports to Asian can expand in coming years. We expect Chinese exporters to continue to push to expand shipments to Asian EMs, building on the success this strategy has had in recent years. However, the rising resistance against these exports increases the likelihood of more material restrictive policy measures to rein them in,” the ratings agency said.\n\nThe report showed that import from China between November 2023 to November 2025 jumped 13 to 15 percent in India and Malaysia, while it surged between 30 and 38 percent in Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\nNotably, in 2025, the shipments zoomed between 75 percent and 110 percent from 2020 in the above mentioned five nations.

{"title": "Why EV loan rates vary so much, and when they’re actually cheaper", "content": "Electric vehicle loans are often advertised as cheaper than standard car loans. Lower interest rates, special green financing, priority processing. On the surface, it sounds like an easy win for buyers considering the switch to electric.\n\nIn reality, EV loan pricing isn’t automatically low. It depends on two specific factors, and missing either of them can wipe out the advantage very quickly.\n\nThe first factor is who is subsidising the loan\n\nThe biggest reason some EVloanslook cheap is not generosity from banks. It’s subsidies, either direct or indirect.\n\nIn many cases, manufacturers absorb part of the interest cost to push adoption. Sometimes state-backed institutions or public sector banks offer concessional rates as part of broader clean-energy goals. In a few cases, the benefit comes from priority sector-style incentives or green financing pools.\n\nThis means the same borrower can see very different EV loan rates depending on the lender and the vehicle brand. If there’s no subsidy in play, the rate difference between an EV loan and a regular car loan often shrinks sharply.\n\nThe headline rate only stays low as long as someone else is helping pay for it.\n\nThe second factor is how lenders see risk and resale\n\nBanks price loans based on risk, not ideology. For EVs, two risks matter most: battery life and resale value.\n\nIf the lender is confident that the battery warranty is long, replacement costs are predictable, and resale demand is stable, they’re more comfortable offering better rates. This is why EV loans for established models from large manufacturers are often cheaper than loans for newer or niche models.\n\nWhere uncertainty is higher, interest rates creep up. Some lenders quietly offset perceived risk by shortening tenure, increasing margins, or tightening eligibility, even if the product is labelled an “EV loan”.\n\nCheap rates are usually tied to confidence in the asset, not just enthusiasm for electric mobility.\n\nWhy tenure and structure matter more than people think\n\nEven when EV loan rates are lower, the structure of the loan matters. Shorter tenures can make EMIs feel higher despite a lower rate. Balloon payments or step-up EMIs can look attractive upfront but change the real cost over time.\n\nThere’s also the question of whether the loan covers only the vehicle or includes charging equipment and accessories. Not all lenders treat these the same way, and that affects pricing.\n\nA loan that looks cheap on paper can become less so once these details are factored in.\n\nHow EV loans compare to regular car loans in practice\n\nFor borrowers with strong credit profiles, EV loans can be cheaper than standard car loans by a noticeable margin, especially when manufacturer tie-ups are involved.\n\nFor others, the difference may be marginal. In some cases, it disappears entirely once processing fees, insurance bundling, or shorter tenures are considered.\n\nThis is why comparing only interest rates is misleading. The effective cost depends on the full package, not just the number in the ad.\n\nWhen EV loans actually deliver savings\n\nEV loans make the most sense when three things line up. The lender is offering a subsidised or incentive-backed rate, the vehicle is from a manufacturer with strong resale confidence, and the borrower has a solid credit profile.\n\nWhen these conditions are met, borrowing costs can be meaningfully lower than those for petrol or diesel cars. Over the life of the loan, that difference adds up.\n\nWhen they don’t, the EV loan may still be competitive, but it’s not automatically a bargain.\n\nThe bigger takeaway for buyers\n\nThe real question isn’t whether EV loans are cheap. It’s why they’re cheap.\n\nUnderstanding who is absorbing the cost and how the lender views the vehicle helps buyers make better decisions. A low rate with hidden trade-offs is not always better than a slightly higher rate with flexibility and clarity.\n\nEV loans can be an advantage. They just aren’t one by default.", "company": "", "date": "January 18, 2026/ 13:02 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

{"title": "US oversight of Venezuelan oil may unlock Indian pharma dues, revive exports", "content": "The US control of Venezuelan oil assets following the capture of President Nicolás Maduro may offer Indian pharmaceutical companies exporting medicines to the Latin American country a path to recover millions in stalled payments and revive a once-lucrative export market.\n\nWhile the military and political upheaval in Caracas has frozen global energy flows, the prospect of US oversight of Venezuela’s oil wealth could resolve the \"dollar crunch\" that has long plagued Indian exporters.\n\n\"The recent US move signals a strategic shift that carries potential upside for exporters like Indian pharmaceutical firms,\" said a pharmaceutical executive who didn’t want to be named. “These are early days; any boost to oil trade will also impact healthcare spending.”\n\nVenezuela was once a major growth market for Indian pharmaceutical companies, withDr Reddy’sranking it as its fourth-largest export market in FY15, contributing $136 million to sales. At its peak, India pharma exports to Venezuela touched $250 million before the country’s economic collapse.\n\nThe downturn triggered severe losses — Dr Reddy’s alone faced a Rs.508.5 crore ($75–77 million) hit in FY16 due to receivable write-downs, including a single quarterly impact of Rs 430.9 crore ($65 million). After recovering only $4 million of its outstanding balance, the company dissolved its Venezuelan subsidiary in June 2024, making a complete exit form the Latin American nation.\n\nIn FY25, total exports to Venezuela are estimated at Rs. 900 crore ($107 million), which is less than 0.5 per cent of India’s global pharmaceutical exports. Most Indian companies are limited to supplying essential medicines on humanitarian grounds and also operate a cash-and-carry model.Sun PharmaandCiplaare other companies with export presence in Venezuelan market.\n\nVenezuela's 2024 pharmaceutical market paints a complex picture, with significant import growth. The country imported up to $538 million in 2024 from $365 million in 2023, driven by generics. China and Brazil are major suppliers, with Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMOs) playing a vital role in local service provision, according to an Amber Lifesciences and a Scribd report. The imports surged 23.4 percent in the first half of 2025.\n\nWith a population of around three crore, Venezuela is the fifth largest country in South America but given the economic turmoil, it remains a small market. To put it in perspective,  Peru, with a slightly higher population, has a pharmaceutical market five times the size of Venezuela.\n\nIndian firms scaled back or exited due to hyperinflation, currency devaluation, and payment risks that made repatriation of profits nearly impossible. US sanctions and political instability further complicated trade and raised concerns over asset recovery and contract enforcement, turning what was once a promising market into an untenable business environment.\n\nBut with changed circumstances, US control of oil revenues could provide the stable dollar funding needed to guarantee payments for life-saving generics and biologics.\n\nWhile Indian pharma firms have scaled back due to extreme economic instability and payment risks, a US-led restructuring of the Venezuelan oil sector could allow for the repatriation of massive unpaid dividends and a return to humanitarian roles in the region.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 14:29 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Viswanath Pilla"}
{"title": "Your foreign degree is getting more expensive — and it’s not because colleges raised fees", "content": "For thousands of Indian families, the real shock of sending a child abroad in 2026 is not tuition hikes or higher rents. It is the rupee.\n\nOver the past year, the Indian currency’s steady slide against the US dollar, pound and euro has quietly added lakhs of rupees to the cost of overseas education. The change has been gradual enough to escape daily headlines, but for parents wiring fees and students paying rent abroad, the impact is immediate and painful.\n\nA master’s degree in the US that cost Rs 40 lakh two years ago can now easily cost Rs 45-48 lakh, even if the university has not increased its fees much. The difference is not ambition or lifestyle creep. It is currency math. And that math compounds over time.\n\nThe hidden multiplier effect\n\nMost families plan for foreign education in rupees. They calculate a total budget, look at savings,loansand maybe some help from relatives. What often gets underestimated is that almost every major expense—tuition, accommodation, health insurance, even groceries—moves in line with the foreign currency.\n\nWhen the rupee weakens, the cost does not rise once. It rises every semester.\n\nConsider a student in the US paying $40,000 a year in total expenses. At Rs 75 to a dollar, that is Rs 30 lakh. At Rs 83-85, it becomes Rs 33-34 lakh. Over a two-year course, that is an extra Rs 6-8 lakh, without any change in lifestyle or university.\n\nIn the UK and Europe, where fees are often paid in pounds or euros, the impact can be even sharper.\n\nEducation consultants say many families only realise this after the first or second remittance.\n\nLoans don’t insulate you from currency risk\n\nEducation loans soften the immediate burden, but they do not eliminate the problem. The loan is disbursed in tranches, and each tranche is converted at the prevailing exchange rate.\n\nIf the rupee keeps weakening, later disbursements effectively become more expensive than earlier ones. The student ends up borrowing more rupees for the same dollar or pound amount.\n\nThere is a second-order effect too. A larger rupee loan means higher EMIs after graduation, at a time when many students are still settling into their first jobs abroad or back home.\n\nIn other words, currency risk does not stop at admission. It follows you into your working life.\n\nLiving costs are where the pain shows first\n\nTuition fees are fixed and predictable. It is daily life where the currency shock becomes visible. Rent, transport, food, phone bills—everything is paid in foreign currency. When parents send a monthly allowance, the amount in rupees keeps creeping up even if the student is spending exactly the same abroad.\n\nStudents in cities like London, New York, Toronto and Sydney are feeling this the most. Many have already started cutting discretionary spending, sharing rooms, or picking up part-time work just to stay within family budgets.\n\nFor families back home, this often shows up as “temporary top-ups” that slowly become permanent.\n\nThe planning mistake most people make\n\nThe most common mistake is treating foreign education as a one-time cost decision. In reality, it is a multi-year financial commitment exposed to currency, inflation and interest rate risks. Families often plan for the base cost, add a small buffer, and assume things will broadly work out.\n\nBut even a 3-4 percent annual depreciation in the rupee, compounded over two or three years, can blow through that buffer.\n\nWhat makes it harder is that this risk is invisible when you are filling out application forms or paying the first deposit.\n\nCan this be managed at all?\n\nSome families try to pre-fund part of the cost by converting and parking foreign currency early. Others look at education-focused forex cards or overseas accounts to smooth timing risk.\n\nBut for most middle-class households, the real solution is more conservative budgeting: assuming a weaker rupee than today’s rate, not today’s rate itself.\n\nFinancial planners say that when calculating affordability, families should stress-test their numbers at a meaningfully worse exchange rate and see if the plan still holds.\n\nIf it does not, the course was never really affordable—it just looked affordable at one lucky moment in the currency cycle.\n\nThe emotional side of the equation\n\nThere is also a quieter pressure at work. Once a student is already abroad, very few families will say, “We cannot afford this anymore, come back.” So they stretch. They dip into retirement savings. They take top-up loans. They postpone other goals.\n\nThe falling rupee turns what was meant to be an investment in a child’s future into a slow, persistent financial squeeze.\n\nNone of this means studying abroad is a bad idea. But it does mean that in 2026, the real cost of foreign education is no longer just about which university you get into.\n\nIt is also about whether your family balance sheet can survive two or three years of an unfriendly currency.\n\nThe rupee does not announce its impact with a crisis headline. It shows up quietly—in higher remittances, bigger loans, and plans that need constant revision.\n\nAnd for families paying in instalments, it is rewriting the bill in real time.\n\n1. Should I wait for the rupee to strengthen before sending my child abroad?\n\nTrying to time currencies is extremely difficult. If the academic decision makes sense, it is better to plan with a conservative exchange rate assumption rather than wait indefinitely for a better rate that may never come.\n\n2. Does paying fees in one shot protect against currency risk?\n\nIt can reduce risk for that portion of the cost, but living expenses and later payments will still be exposed. Most families cannot pre-fund the entire course anyway.\n\n3. Is studying abroad still worth it despite the rising cost?\n\nIt can be, depending on the course, country and career outcomes. But the decision now needs to be made with much more realistic currency and cost assumptions than in the past.", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 18:31 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

Their technology has enabled the streaming of marquee events such as the 2024 Paris Olympics, Union of European Football Association (“UEFA”) football tournaments, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Awards (commonly known as the ‘Oscars’), and the 2024 U.S. Presidential debates.\n\n“At the upper price band, the company is valued at 6.7x FY25 P/S, translating into a post-issue market capitalisation of ₹78,098 million. It has turned profitable in H1 FY26 and, supported by strong operating leverage, is well positioned to deliver full-year profitability in FY26. Continued investments in R&D to enhance scalability, automation, performance, and user experience further reinforce its positioning as the “industry cloud” for video in the media and entertainment space. In light of these factors, the IPO appears fully priced,” Anand Rathi concluded.\n\nAmagi Media Labs represents a very different proposition from most recent Indian IPOs, being a technology-led, SaaS-oriented business with meaningful global exposure, said Prasenjit Paul, Equity Research Analyst & Fund Manager of 129 Wealth Fund. He added that the company operates in a scalable segment driven by programmatic digital advertising and cloud-based media services, which benefit from the ongoing shift of advertising budgets away from traditional television to data-driven and connected-TV platforms. “That gives it long-term growth potential, but also means performance will be driven by execution, client retention and platform economics rather than near-term earnings,” he said.\n\n“The issue pricing appears more grounded compared to earlier private-market valuations, which improves the risk-reward for investors willing to look beyond short-term volatility. However, as with most technology IPOs, valuation sensitivity and the path to sustained profitability remain key considerations, especially in a global advertising cycle that can be uneven. In the current market environment, IPO participation needs to be selective and aligned with individual risk profiles. Capital-intensive, cash-generating businesses and growth-oriented technology companies like Amagi should be evaluated very differently. For investors who already have a stable core portfolio, this IPO can work as a selective growth allocation with a longer-term horizon, rather than a one-size-fits-all or listing-day trade,” the analyst said.\n\nFollow allIPO newshere.", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 17:33 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Debaroti Adhikary"}
{"title": "Absence of safeguard duty to hit steel companies' margins in Q3, say analysts", "content": "Major brokerages expect large steelmakers to report weaker quarter-on-quarter performance in October–December 2025 (Q3 FY26), with lower realisations and softer EBITDA per tonne, as steel prices stayed sluggish for most of the quarter.\n\nAnalysts say one reason was a gap in import protection. The first phase of the safeguard duty on certain imported steel grades, announced in April 2025, expired in the first week of November, and its absence for part of the quarter reduced the competitiveness of domestic steel versus cheaper imports. The government later renewed the safeguard duty regime on December 30, 2025, extending it till April 2028.\n\nMargins were also squeezed by higher global spot prices for coking coal, a key input that many Indian steelmakers import. This pressure persisted despite lower iron ore costs and better operating leverage, which otherwise could have cushioned profitability.\n\n\"We expect margins to sequentially decrease around Rs 1,530 per tonne on average in Q3 for steel companies, mainly led by lower steel prices. The benefits of operating leverage and lower iron ore prices were partially offset by higher coking coal costs,\" said Amarjeet Maurya, deputy vice president, fundamental research, Kotak Securities.\n\nOn steel prices for the quarter, Maurya added, \"We expect an average decrease in steel realisations of around Rs 2,060 per tonne quarter-on-quarter across our steel coverage; while prices of both long and flat products decreased in the quarter, the decline was more prominent in flat products, given the absence of safeguard duty during most parts of November/December 2025\".\n\nAccording to earnings estimates by brokerage firms, most major steelmakers, such asJSW Steel,Tata Steel,Jindal Steel, andSteel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL), are expected to report flatness or declines in margins and realisations. The public sector utility SAIL is expected to fare worse than the others in profitability due to price declines, as well as no new capacities being on-streamed, said a report from Systematix Institutional Equities.\n\nStrong sales volumes are expected to slightly mitigate the losses for the large steel mills, with domestic deliveries by most firms growing both annually and quarter-on-quarter for the October-December quarter. Elara Securities estimated that of the firms in its coverage, sequential volumes are expected to grow 7 percent, while the same year-on-year is seen at around 13 percent.\n\nJindal Stainlessis set to post 11 percent year-on-year volume growth, alongside a 2 percent year-on-year improvement in EBITDA per tonne, Elara noted in a quarterly preview. However, the firm's consolidated EBITDA is expected to decline by around 0.8 percent over the July-September quarter.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 23:08 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Shiladitya Pandit"}
{"title": "MC EXCLUSIVEBudget 2026 likely to unveil mining policy to cut imports, boost silver, copper production", "content": "The budget for the financial year 2026-27 is likely to build on the previous year’s mining reforms through a formal policy aimed at reducing dependence on imports and stepping up silver, copper and zinc production, people aware of policy discussions have said.\n\nThe policy is expected to offer a larger role for private players in mining and processing of the three metals to meet growing industrial demand, as global supply chains come under strain, they said.\n\n“There have been discussions about giving a real push to metals. The focus is on silver, copper and zinc because these are critical for manufacturing and also where India has some resource base,” one of the sources cited above said.\n\n“Silver and copper, zinc are immediate priorities. The idea is to use domestic resources better, improve recovery from existing mines and bring in private players to expand capacity.”\n\nThe policy is also expected to look at improving recovery and refining of silver, largely produced as a by-product of copper and zinc mining.\n\nIndia is one of the world’s largest consumers of silver but remains heavily dependent on imports, especially from China, which recently imposed curbs on some metal exports.\n\n“There is a clear view that India cannot keep importing critical metals if it wants to scale up manufacturing,” the source said.\n\nThe previous budget unveiled a string of reforms which eased exploration for critical minerals, streamlined auctions and encouraged greater private participation.\n\nFocus on silver, copper and zinc\n\nSilver will be a key focus because of its rising use in electronics, solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\n“India is already a significant producer of zinc, and there is capacity that can be expanded,” the person, familiar with the discussions, said. “If you improve zinc and copper mining, you automatically improve silver output. The thinking is to start by giving more mining leases to private players in silver-linked projects.”\n\nThe government policy may also open up copper mining. India imports a large share of its copper needs even though it has known reserves. With demand rising from power, construction, electronics and electric vehicles, sources said domestic production must be scaled up.\n\nRare earths: long-term but unavoidable\n\nRare earth mining is seen as a longer-term goal and India has little choice but to start laying the groundwork now if it wants to move beyond assembly-led manufacturing.\n\n“Rare earths are not an overnight story,” a person familiar with the sector said. “First you need detailed geological surveys. Then you have to deal with land issues, because many potential areas are on farm land. From prospecting to actual mining can take five to six years.”\n\nRare earth processing is also highly polluting, especially at the smelting and refining stage. This makes environmental clearances and local opposition major hurdles.\n\n“But if India wants to make electronics, batteries and advanced cars, it cannot just import everything,” the sources said. “You cannot make batteries, catalytic converters or most electronics without rare earth metals. Today we import almost all of this.”\n\nProspecting for rare earths has technically been opened, but private participation is still limited and refining capacity is almost absent, sources said.\n\n“There is hardly any large-scale refining of rare earths in India,” the person said. “Battery making is also very limited. Except for a few projects, often in collaboration with foreign players, there is no strong domestic ecosystem yet.”\n\nA mining policy will fit into the government’s broader plan to strengthen domestic manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports for critical inputs.\n\nWith global supply chains becoming more uncertain and China tightening controls on some metals, India is increasingly vulnerable.\n\n“The manufacturing push will fail if inputs are all imported,” the sources said. “Mining is messy, slow and politically difficult but without it you cannot build a serious industrial base.”\n\nBy starting with silver, copper and zinc, and gradually preparing the ground for rare earths, the government hopes to move India from an assembly-led model to one that is more integrated, from raw material to finished product.\n\nRare earths metals are needed to make super-strong magnets that are used in military applications such as drone and fighter jets and also to power motors in EVs and wind turbines.", "company": "", "date": "January 12, 2026/ 14:17 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Meghna Mittal"}
{"title": "GIFT City explained: A new gateway to global stocks, mutual funds and insurance", "content": "GIFT City, India’s International Financial Services Centre, lets investors access global stocks, dollar-denominated mutual funds, and insurance. Digital onboarding, simple operations, and tax-efficient structures make GIFT City a convenient platform for building wealth while diversifying internationally.\n\nGIFT City as gateway to global stocks\n\nIndian investors can access global equities through GIFT City’s International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) exchanges (India INX and NSE IFSC), including Un-Sponsored Depository Receipts (UDRs) and broader exposure via regulated brokers under the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA).\n\nThese instruments provide access to US-listed stocks in a structurally compliant, foreign-currency framework without needing overseas brokerage accounts, enhancing operational and regulatory simplicity. When you invest through the GIFT City UDR route, your investment is limited to 50 US blue-chip stocks. Through Gift City NSC IFSC, one can also buy fractional shares.\n\n“Direct overseas investing still allows a broader universe, but GIFT City’s onshore IFSC infrastructure reduces costs, provides STT and stamp duty exemptions, and offers tighter integration with India’s capital flows under RBI’s LRS,” says Vishal Goraddia, Fund Manager, Aikyam India Discovery Fund, Aikyam Capital Group.\n\nIndian investors can access global equities through GIFT City in a few simple steps. First, they need to open an account with a broker regulated by IFSCA that operates on IFSC exchanges such as India INX or NSE IFSC. Next, they complete digital KYC and fund the account by remitting money under RBI’s Liberalized Remittance Scheme in the required foreign currency. Once funded, investors can buy unsponsored depository receipts linked to US-listed stocks.\n\nDollar-Denominated Mutual Funds via IFSC\n\nGIFT City-based mutual funds, especially the new dollar-denominated passive FoFs (e.g., S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 FoFs), operate under IFSCA with no SEBI overseas caps, using LRS remittances for direct exchange-traded fund (ETF) exposure. Structurally, they can avoid constraints that India-domiciled global schemes face due to investment limits and regulatory suspensions.\n\n“IFSC funds benefit from streamlined cross-border regulation and often accumulate ETF strategies that aim for better compounding and tax efficiency. In contrast, India-based funds are subject to domestic fund caps and layered taxation, which can constrain diversification and return efficiency,” says Goraddia.\n\nIndian investors can invest in GIFT City–based mutual funds by opening an account with an IFSCA-regulated fund platform, distributor, or IFSC banking unit that offers these schemes. Then the KYC process needs to be completed. The investment is then made into dollar-denominated passive fund-of-funds, such as S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100 FoFs, which directly invest in overseas ETFs. These funds operate under IFSCA, not SEBI, so they are not constrained by India’s overseas investment limits.\n\nGIFT City Insurance Tailored for NRIs\n\nResident Indians generally cannot buy GIFT City insurance because these products are regulated under an offshore-style IFSC framework, sold in foreign currency, and designed mainly for NRIs.\n\n“Insurance products offered through GIFT City are increasingly positioned to serve NRIs and globally mobile professionals with foreign-currency cash flows and cross-border estate or retirement needs, supported by a growing IFSC insurance ecosystem and recent expansion of licensed insurers and intermediaries,” says Goraddia.\n\nIFSCA has an IIIO (Insurance Intermediary Offices) framework related to the insurance and reinsurance business. There are issuers approved and licensed by IFSCA in GIFT City. The major ones are HDFC Life International, ICICI Prudential, IndiaFirst, Star Union and others. The issuers have USD-denominated products predominantly for NRIs.\n\nThere are ULIP insurance-embedded wealth structures available for investors who are looking for insurance with investments. Pure protection term plans, endowment plans and dollar-denominated health insurance are also available.\n\n“As mentioned, these are USD-denominated; hence, the currency fluctuation and USD appreciation can add to the corpus in the long run,” says Niteen Dongare, CEO & Head - GIFT City, IFSC, Anand Rathi International Ventures IFSC.\n\nThe ULIP structures also invest in global markets in dollars with several fund strategies like global equities, gold, and an AI strategy, which investors can select, and hence, this global diversification and investment in global markets can also benefit the investors. “Other benefits include that the repatriation of monies is easy for an NRI. The process of onboarding is digital with minimum documentation,” says Dongare.\n\nThe maturity proceeds are tax-free under section 10 (10 D) with no premium limit restrictions. For an NRI who is a tax resident of a country that has a DTAA with India and the policy is 10D compliant, there is a Nil TDS deduction on the maturity amount, and there is no need of a tax residency certificate (TRC) and Form 10. Thus, income on maturity will not be subject to taxes while filing ITR in India.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 07:13 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Anagh Pal"}
{"title": "OPINION | Tax boost in Budget 2026 could ease India's housing paradox", "content": "In 2025, India’s real estate market will be remembered for extremes. Luxury apartments are selling fast, premium prices are easily absorbed, and developers’ balance sheets are stronger than ever. However, beneath this success lies a troubling contradiction: affordable housing—the backbone of urban India—is quietly disappearing. This isn’t a demand crisis but a crisis rooted in economics, policy design, and misaligned incentives.\n\nRecent market data paints a stark picture. Knight Frank India reports that the supply-to-demand ratio for homes priced below ₹50 lakhs has collapsed to 0.36 in the first half of 2025, down from a balanced 1.05 in 2019. In simpler terms, for every 100 affordable homes demanded, only 36 are being supplied.\n\nThe shift in developer focus is dramatic. Affordable housing accounted for over half of new residential launches in 2018; today, it represents just 17%. Sales in this segment have dropped nearly 17% year-on-year, even as luxury housing records its fastest-ever absorption rates. The paradox is evident: premium projects are selling quickly, yet unsold high-ticket inventory piles up. Meanwhile, lower- and middle-income households find homeownership increasingly unattainable. The market is oversupplying where demand is limited and undersupplying where it is structurally deep.\n\nWhy Developers Are Walking Away\n\nThe lack of affordable housing supply isn’t due to a lack of intent by developers. It’s primarily driven by razor-thin margins and unviable economics. Rising construction costs—cement, steel, labour, compliance, and most notably, urban land prices—have outpaced the growth of lower-income household incomes. Affordable housing, by definition, operates on tight margins, whereas luxury housing doesn’t.\n\nFor developers, the decision is clear: premium projects offer larger margins and pricing flexibility. In contrast, even small cost increases in affordable housing can wipe out profitability. Geography further complicates matters. Affordable land is usually available on city peripheries, but these areas often lack sufficient transport, social infrastructure, and employment opportunities. Consequently, developers find it difficult to make projects financially viable—either land in the city is too expensive, or peripheral areas are too disconnected.\n\nThe Illusion of Affordability\n\nThere’s a growing narrative that housing affordability has improved. Mumbai’s EMI-to-income ratio, for example, has dropped below 50%, now sitting at around 47%. This decline is attributed to lower interest rates and stable income growth. But this statistic hides the true barrier to homeownership for lower-middle-income households. The real challenge isn’t just the monthly EMI but the high upfront costs—down payments, stamp duty, registration charges, and rising property prices—making homeownership increasingly out of reach.\n\nMoreover, a significant portion of the affordable housing target audience is self-employed or earns informal income. Traditional banking requirements, such as salary slips, formal credit histories, and tax returns, exclude many genuine buyers from institutional financing. So, while demand exists, access does not.\n\nAt the heart of the issue lies a disconnect between policy intentions and market realities. The government’s commitment to “Housing for All” remains clear, and initiatives such as PMAY 2.0 reflect that vision. However, the frameworks governing taxation and incentives have not evolved to match rising costs.\n\nTake the current GST regime: residential housing is split into two categories—“affordable” projects taxed at 1% and all others taxed at 5%. To qualify as affordable, a home must cost less than ₹45 lakhs and meet strict size limits. These thresholds were set in 2017, and in 2026, they are outdated. Industry bodies, such as CREDAI, have proposed raising the affordability threshold to ₹90 lakhs, which would reflect current land and construction costs. Additionally, the legal definition of “affordable” should reflect the distinct price and cost dynamics between rural and urban areas.\n\nThe Hidden Tax Burden\n\nA major issue within the existing framework is that residential real estate developers cannot claim input tax credits, unlike other industries. Although GST on cement and tiles has been reduced, developers can’t offset these taxes against the GST collected from buyers. As a result, the 1% tax rate on affordable housing doesn’t account for input taxes embedded in construction costs, leading to a cascading tax effect. This hidden tax burden inflates prices, undermining the very goal of affordable housing. Allowing input tax credits for affordable projects or reducing GST on works contracts would directly reduce construction costs and make housing more affordable.\n\nThe Case for Direct Tax Incentives\n\nTo level the playing field, income tax incentives are essential. The reintroduction of Section 80-IBA of the Income Tax Act, which previously offered a 100% tax holiday on profits from affordable housing projects, could boost supply once again. However, the section had limitations, including a project life cap of five years, which is too short for the nature of the industry.\n\nTo revitalise affordable housing, Section 80-IBA could be revamped by:\n\nAdditionally, the ₹2 lakh cap on homeloaninterest deductions has become outdated. Raising this cap to ₹5 lakhs would offer immediate relief to families struggling with high EMIs.\n\nFurther, employers could be incentivised to build industrial and employee housing through higher depreciation allowances on employee residences. This would address migrant housing shortages while reducing pressure on urban slums.\n\nThe Role of States and Cities\n\nState governments and local authorities hold significant power to promote affordable housing through stamp duty and registration charge reductions. Currently, these high charges act as an additional burden on lower- and middle-income households. By reducing these rates for affordable housing projects, immediate relief could be provided.\n\nA responsive regulatory environment that speeds up approvals and reduces red tape can also make projects more viable. Urban development policy should align private and public interests, for example, by offering higher Floor Space Index (FSI) in prime locations for affordable housing projects.\n\nLooking Beyond Housing\n\nAffordable housing can’t be solved in isolation. Urban congestion, job concentration, and land scarcity are interconnected challenges. Long-term strategies must include economic decentralisation, satellite city development, and employment-linked housing incentives.\n\nLand is finite, and housing demand is perpetual. The affordable housing crisis is not inevitable. It’s a result of outdated definitions, mismatched policies, and tax distortions. By recalibrating what “affordable” truly means in 2026 and addressing the fiscal paradox developers face, India can restore balance to its housing market. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of “Housing for All” can once again become a reality, both socially and commercially, with the right structural reforms.\n\n(Deepesh Chheda is Partner, Dhruva Advisors.)\n\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 15:26 IST", "category": "opinion", "author": "Deepesh Chheda"}

{"title": "Gold and silver storm to records as Fed fight, Iran spur demand", "content": "Gold and silver climbed to record highs as the US Justice Department threatened the Federal Reserve with a criminal indictment, reviving concerns over its independence, while protests in Iran supported haven demand.\n\nThe yellow metal spiked toward $4,600 an ounce, while silver neared $85, after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the potential indictment “should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure” to influence the bank’s interest-rate decisions. The dollar weakened and US 10-year Treasury yields edged higher after his comments. Repeated attacks on the Fed last year by the Trump administration were a major factor hurting the dollar and aiding gold.\n\nDeadly protests in Iran, meanwhile, increased the haven appeal of precious metals on the possibility the Islamic Republic could be overthrown. US President Donald Trump said Sunday he was mulling potential options on Iran, while reiterating threats to take Greenland and questioning the value of the NATO alliance, just over a week after seizing Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.\n\nPrecious metals are at the center of a powerful upward re-rating on a confluence of tailwinds that has supercharged demand. Among the drivers, falling US interest rates, heightened geopolitical tensions, lower trust in the US dollar, and the challenge to the Fed have aided gold and silver. More than a dozen money managers said they’ve opted not to take too much money off the table in gold, holding conviction in its long-term appeal.\n\n“It’s a reminder of how many uncertainties markets are juggling — geopolitics, the growth/rates debate, and now a fresh headline-driven reminder of an institutional risk premium,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets in Singapore.\n\nThe US Supreme Court, meanwhile, set Wednesday for the next opinion on Trump’s tariffs. A ruling against the levies would undercut his signature economy policy and deliver his biggest legal defeat since returning to the White House.\n\nSilver jumped almost 6% to a record $84.6090 an ounce. The white metal surged almost 150% last year as a historic short squeeze gripped the market in October, and the dominant spot market in London saw continued tightness as tariff fears prevent metal from flowing from packed warehouses in the US.\n\n“We see the deficit in the silver market continuing throughout 2026, primarily on higher investment demand,” BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions Inc. said in a note on Monday, adding that industrial demand also tightened the physical market to an unprecedented degree.\n\nTraders are also waiting for results from the Section 232 investigation that may lead to US tariffs on silver, platinum and palladium. That report is expected in January.\n\nRead More: Trump’s Options If Supreme Court Says His Tariffs Are Illegal\n\nLast week’s US jobs data left expectations for additional interest-rate cuts intact, supporting non-yielding precious metals. Markets have priced in at least two cuts this year, after the Fed delivered three consecutive reductions in the second half.\n\n“Softer US labor market prints have intensified expectations that the Fed will pivot to rate cuts earlier and more aggressively than previously anticipated,” Priyanka Sachdeva, senior market analyst for brokerage Phillip Nova Pte in Singapore wrote in a note. The shift “erodes real yields and heightens opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold,” she added.\n\nGold rose as much 2%, and traded 1.6% higher at $4,584.44 an ounce at 3:31 p.m. in Singapore. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index dipped 0.2%. Both palladium and platinum advanced more than 3%.", "company": "", "date": "January 12, 2026/ 13:41 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Bloomberg"}

{"title": "MC EXCLUSIVEOnce a budget market, Noida now draws HNIs with branded homes", "content": "Noida, once known for offering affordable housing for the salaried middle class in the National Capital Region (NCR), is now becoming a hub for high-end residential developments, including branded residences by top hospitality, lifestyle and luxury brands.\n\nDriven by expanding job opportunities, infrastructure growth, rising wealth, and evolving buyer aspirations, the city is swiftly developing into a luxury and branded-residence destination, attracting high-net-worth individuals (HNIs), non-resident Indians (NRIs) and entrepreneurial buyers who once focused primarily on Mumbai, Delhi and Gurugram.\n\nBranded residences take centre stage\n\nNoida has seen a string of branded residences by Gulshan Group, M3M India and Smartworld Developers. In October 2025, M3M India collaborated with global luxury jewellery and watches brand Jacob & Co. to launch M3M-Jacob & Co Residences.\n\nSimilarly, in December, the Indian Hotels Company Ltd (IHCL), the owner of Taj Hotels, has collaborated with Noida-based realty firm Gulshan Group to develop a Taj hotel and Taj Branded Serviced Apartments in Noida’s Sector 129 along the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway.\n\nAlso Read: From Trump Towers to Jacob & Co, branded residences lead India’s luxury housing wave\n\nJoining the league of branded residences, Smartworld Developers has collaborated with Lebanon-based fashion designer and lifestyle brand, Elie Saab, for another branded residence project in Sector 98 in Noida. Besides these, M3M India is also planning to launch Trump-branded residences in Noida.\n\nThe apartments in these branded residences in Noida typically range from Rs 9 crore to Rs 25 crore, depending on their size, location, and the brand.\n\nMarket observers said that these high-end property launches mark a departure from Noida’s traditional product mix, where housing was largely driven by mid-income segments. Developers are now focusing on differentiated offerings tailored to luxury, lifestyle and brand-conscious buyers.\n\nDevelopers and market analysts said that the primary buyers of Noida’s luxury and branded residences include HNIs, NRIs, corporates, entrepreneurs from tier-1 and 2 cities, and some celebrities.\n\nYukti Nagpal, Director, Gulshan Group, said that buyers of high-end apartments are CXO-level professionals, entrepreneurs, and NRIs seeking space, comfort, and long-term value.\n\n“Compared to Mumbai, Delhi, or Gurugram, Noida still offers larger homes and better value, which is increasingly influencing premium homebuyer decisions,” she said.\n\nPankaj Bansal, the owner of M3M India and founder of Smartworld Developers, said buyers are largely people who have arrived in their lives and want their presence to be felt.\n\n“Either these people have a lot of money, or they are famous in the area they operate. The second category is the wealthy people who want to move from tier-2 cities to tier-1 cities. They want their second generation to live in tier-1 cities. The third ones are the CEOs and CFOs of large multinational companies,” he said.\n\nVishal Raheja, Founder and Managing Director, InvestoXpert Advisors, said that investment motivation plays an equally strong role in the purchase of such properties.\n\n\"NRIs and strategic investors are also actively acquiring premium residences driven by strong capital appreciation potential, attractive rental yields in prime business corridors, and limited high-quality inventory that ensures sustained resale value,” he said.\n\nRaheja added that an emerging segment of younger, affluent professionals and dual-income households in tech, finance, and services also prefer to buy branded properties as they seek exclusivity, security, wellness and globally benchmarked amenities.\n\nKey factors driving growth of luxury or branded residences\n\nAshish Narain Agarwal, the founder and Managing Director of PropertyPistol, a real estate consultant, said that infrastructure development, strategic urban planning, expanding expressways, metro connectivity, and proximity to the upcoming Noida International Airport are fueling Noida’s transformation.\n\nAlso Read: M3M–Jacob & Co branded 5BHK residences sell out at Rs 40,000 per sq ft in Noida — highest-ever rate for the city\n\nStrong corporate growth driven by IT parks, industrial corridors, and global capability centres (GCC) has created a high-income working population seeking premium lifestyle housing.\n\n“Alongside this, growing demand for modern amenities, wellness-led environments, security, and branded living experiences has encouraged developers to introduce world-class luxury offerings. As a result, Noida is evolving from a functional residential zone into a sophisticated luxury destination offering global-standard living, lifestyle convenience, and strong investment prospects,” he said.\n\nRavi Nirwal, Principal Partner and Sales Director, Square Yards, said that the availability of large, contiguous land parcels in Noida has allowed developers to plan integrated, low-density projects with premium amenities, which is often difficult in more saturated markets.\n\nComparison of Noida with Mumbai, Delhi, and Gurugram\n\nRaheja of InvestoXperts said that Noida today stands out as one of India’s most competitive premium real estate destinations, offering a balance of affordability, lifestyle excellence, and future-ready infrastructure.\n\nAccording to data from InvestoXpert, property prices in Noida typically range between Rs 9,000 – Rs 15,000 per sqft, with ultra-luxury developments oscillating between Rs 15,000 – Rs 40,000 per sq ft, compared with Delhi-NCR’s regional luxury average of Rs 23,000 per sq ft.\n\nAverage pricing in Gurugram ranges between Rs 20,000 and Rs 37,000 per sq ft in premium corridors, while Mumbai’s average pricing is significantly higher, from Rs 40,000 per sq ft to over Rs 100,000 in marquee micro-markets.\n\nUnlike Mumbai, where ultra luxury is often defined by scarcity and location, or central Delhi, where legacy and exclusivity play a major role, Noida’s premium offerings are more focused on scale, modern infrastructure and planned development, said Nirwal of Square Yards.\n\n“When compared to Gurugram, which has a more mature luxury ecosystem and proximity to corporate headquarters, Noida is emerging as an alternative for buyers prioritising newer infrastructure and comparatively competitive pricing,” he said.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 09:49 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Ashish Mishra"}
{"title": "HCL Tech Q3 results review: Fundamentals improve, but brokerages cautious on near-term stock outlook", "content": "HCL Technologies’ Q3 FY26 results have strengthened confidence in its operational momentum and deal pipeline, but brokerages are not uniformly bullish on the stock, signalling only a limited near-term upside despite improved earnings visibility.\n\nShares ofHCL Techclosed marginally higher at Rs 1,667 on Monday, up 0.34 percent, ahead of the results. The stock remains down over 16 percent over the past year, underperforming the broader market. That is also a key reason brokerages are tempering enthusiasm even after a strong quarter.\n\nBrokerage commentary broadly agreed that the business is executing well, but valuations and seasonal risks cap upside, advising against aggressive buying at current levels.\n\nWhat worked: Deal wins, guidance upgrade, margins\n\nHCL Tech delivered a strong operational quarter, marked by a 43 percent year-on-year jump in trailing twelve-month deal TCV, improved margins, and a guidance upgrade. Services revenue growth guidance for FY26 was raised to 4.75-5.25 percent in constant currency, placing HCL Tech at the upper end of the peer group.\n\nCiti issued a Neutral rating with a target price of Rs 1,700, noting that HCL Tech’s forward indicators are better than peers, aided by rising headcount and management focus on identifying new spend areas. Citi also raised FY27-FY28 earnings estimates by 2 percent.\n\nHSBC gave a Hold call with a target of Rs 1,815, highlighting that HCL Tech has sustained Q2 momentum into Q3 and now sits at the top end of the peer growth range. HSBC sees operating margins trending towards 18-19 percent in FY27, with a 5-6 percent medium-term revenue CAGR appearing achievable.\n\nWhy caution persists despite a strong quarter\n\nDespite the upbeat fundamentals, brokerages remain wary of near-term performance of HCL Tech shares, citing seasonality, valuation comfort, and historical return patterns.\n\nCLSA kept a Hold rating with a target of Rs 1,661, pointing out that even at the upper end of guidance, Q4 implies negative sequential growth in constant currency, largely due to seasonal weakness in the products business. CLSA also flagged that historically, HCL Tech stock has delivered weak returns between Q4 and Q2, compared with strong gains in the Q2-Q3 period.\n\nThe bullish pocket: AI-led services strategy\n\nThe one clear positive differentiator is HCL Tech’s AI-focused, services-led growth strategy, which is gaining traction.\n\nNomura stood out with a Buy rating and a target price of Rs 1,810, implying an upside of nearly 9 percent. It cited a clear earnings beat, guidance lift, and margin resilience. Nomura views the company’s asset-light, services-centric AI push as structurally positive, while expecting margins to normalise favourably in FY27.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The group also outlined the scale of power generation it plans to deliver from its renewable energy hub in Kutch.\n\n“We are well progressed on this entire ecosystem,” said Karan Suri, Senior Vice President – New Energy, Reliance Industries Ltd, adding that the integrated platform was designed to address geopolitical risks such as tariffs and supply-chain disruptions.\n\nCells commissioned, yields disclosed\n\nReliance said its heterojunction-based solar cell manufacturing in Jamnagar has now been commissioned and is being ramped up, while solar module manufacturing — already operational — has achieved manufacturing yields of 94–95 percent, a metric disclosed for the first time.\n\nThe company is setting up an end-to-end solar manufacturing chain from polysilicon to modules in Jamnagar, starting with 10 GW of annual capacity, scalable to 20 GW.\n\nOn upstream integration, Reliance said its pilot ingot line has already been commissioned, with in-house slicing of G12-size wafers underway.\n\n“This is a remarkable achievement by our teams, and we will be scaling it up at a giga scale. Polysilicon and solar glass facilities — among the largest outside China — are nearing commissioning, with key equipment already installed,” Suri said.\n\nBattery gigafactory progressing\n\nOn batteries, Reliance said construction of its 40 GWh battery gigafactory covering cells, packs and containerised energy storage systems is in full swing.\n\n“All critical equipment has already reached the site, and commissioning will begin in phases during the current year. The company has previously announced plans to scale battery capacity to 100 GWh,” Suri said.\n\nPower generation at unprecedented scale\n\nThe manufacturing build-out will feed directly into Reliance’s planned round-the-clock renewable energy generation hub at its 550,000-acre site in Kutch, Gujarat.\n\nAccording to the company, the site has the potential to host 125–150 GW of solar capacity, which could translate into nearly 300 billion units of electricity annually on a round-the-clock basis.\n\n\"For context, an annual installation rate of 30 GW of solar capacity would generate about 35–40 billion units of electricity per year, a level of power supply that exceeds the annual electricity consumption of several countries globally,\" Suri said.\n\nExport markets for green molecules\n\nBeyond power, Reliance said its integrated ecosystem — including electrolyser manufacturing and compressed biogas plants — is being positioned to supply green fuels and molecules to overseas markets.\n\nThe company identified Japan, South Korea, and Europe as priority regions, where it is seeing strong interest from customers and governments to lock in long-term offtake contracts for green ammonia or green hydrogen.\n\nDigital control room live\n\nFor the first time, Reliance confirmed that the central utility and control block for its solar manufacturing ecosystem is already operational. The AI-enabled system digitally connects all facilities, enabling centralised monitoring of operations, shutdowns, yield optimisation, material traceability, and quality control with minimal human intervention.\n\n“This is effectively a control room which is already up and running over all our facilities,” Suri said, describing it as a key differentiator versus global peers.\n\nThe company added that utilities such as substations, cooling towers, chemical storage and effluent treatment plants have been built upfront for 20 GW capacity, allowing future expansion without major incremental infrastructure.", "company": "", "date": "January 16, 2026/ 22:59 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Sweta Goswami"}

India had a total trade of USD 1.68 billion with Iran in 2024-25 (April-March), which included USD 1.24 billion in exports primarily from the farm sector. India’s top exported products to Iran were cereals, animal fodder, tea and coffee, spices, fruits and vegetables, and pharmaceuticals. ”As we all know that the trade with Iran is outside the sanctions imposed by US, given the humanitarian nature of most of these products. And therefore, FIEO is of the view that the impact of additional 25 per cent tariff imposed by US on any country doing business with Iran will almost have no impact on India,” FIEO said.\n\nThe US announcement is important as exporters are keeping their fingers crossed on the impact of the additional duty. Indian exporters are already reeling under the impact of the steep 50 per cent tariffs imposed by the US. Major Indian exports to Iran include rice, tea, sugar, pharmaceuticals, manmade staple fibres, electrical machinery and artificial jewellery, while major imports consist of dry fruits, inorganic/organic chemicals and, glassware.\n\nA key aspect of India-Iran ties is the joint development of the Chabahar port. Located in the Sistan-Balochistan province on the energy-rich Iran’s southern coast, the port is being developed by India and Iran to boost connectivity and trade ties. India’s merchandise exports to Iran rose by 1.55 per cent to USD 1.24 billion in 2024-25, while imports dipped by 29.32 per cent to USD 441.83 million.", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 16:40 IST", "category": "business", "author": "PTI"}
{"title": "Emversity raises $30 million in funding from Premji Invest, Lightspeed, Z47", "content": "Emversity, a higher-education embedded training and employability platform, has raised $30 million (around Rs 271 crore) in a Series A funding round led by Premji Invest, with participation from existing investors Lightspeed and Z47.\n\nThe capital will be deployed towards scaling Emversity’s university partnerships, expanding into new skilling verticals, and deepening employer-aligned workforce pipelines across sectors facing skilled talent shortages.\n\nEmversity founder and CEO Vivek Sinha told Moneycontrol the company’s immediate focus is campus expansion and disciplined execution. \"We are currently present across more than 40 campuses, and this round gives us the ability to scale that model meaningfully while maintaining outcome consistency,\" he said.\n\nWhat does Emversity do?\n\nFounded in 2023, Emversity partners with higher-education institutions to embed industry-aligned curriculum, applied training, apprenticeships and placement support directly into degree programmes. At the same time, it works with employers to define job-ready skill requirements and co-create workforce pipelines.\n\nThe company also operates dedicated skill centres in affiliation with the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), allowing it to run both university-embedded programmes and short-term training tracks, particularly in healthcare and hospitality.\n\nSinha said the company’s approach starts with employer demand rather than student supply. \"We don't design programmes in isolation. We start with what employers need on day one and then work backwards with universities to embed that into existing academic structures,\" he said.\n\nWhy raise capital now?\n\nSinha said the Series A round was entirely inbound and not part of a planned fundraising process.\n\n\"We were sufficiently capitalised and had planned to go to the market in 2026, but the scale we reached and the institutional partnerships we built led to inbound interest,\" he said.\n\nThe company has not disclosed the valuation of the round.\n\nWhy did investors back Emversity?\n\nKaveesh Chawla, partner at Premji Invest, said the firm’s decision to lead the round was driven by Emversity’s focus on employability outcomes rather than credentials alone.\n\n\"Our investment in Emversity reflects our strong conviction in the role of outcome-oriented education and skilling in driving long-term social and economic impact in India,\" Chawla said. \"As the need to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world employability grows, Emversity’s student-centric approach, focus on apprenticeships, and strong alignment with industry partners position it well to address this gap at scale.\"\n\nRajat Agarwal, Managing Director at Z47, said the company is building critical employability infrastructure in sectors central to India’s growth. \"The team has demonstrated consistency and resilience in a complex operating environment, and this round supports the next phase of scaling a durable, employment-led higher education platform,\" he said, adding that Z47 was pleased to continue partnering with Emversity.\n\nHarsha Kumar, partner at Lightspeed, said Emversity’s decision to work within universities — rather than bypass them — sets it apart. \"Emversity is addressing a fundamental gap between education and employability in India by working within existing institutions rather than around them,\" he said. \"Vivek and the team have built a disciplined, outcomes-led platform that aligns universities, employers, and learners over the long term.\"\n\nScale so far and what’s next\n\nEmversity currently supports over 4,500 learners across more than 40 campuses in 23 states. Its employer partners include Fortis Healthcare, Apollo Hospitals, Aster, KIMS, IHCL (Taj Hotels) and Lemon Tree Hotels. The company employs around 700 people.\n\nEmversity last raised $5 million in its pre-Series A funding round in April last year, led by Lightspeed and Z47. The latest round takes its total funding to $46 million.\n\nLooking ahead, Sinha said the biggest challenge will be maintaining outcome consistency as the company scales. \"The thesis is already proven—there is demand from employers and students,\" he said. \"The real challenge is execution and discipline. If we can deliver the same quality of outcomes at scale, we build a great institution.\"", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 06:34 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Aryaman Gupta"}

A total of 1,675 shares declined against 1,233 advancing shares on the NSE. Consolidation with rangebound trading may continue for a few more sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:\n\nRajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities\n\nPunjab National Bank| CMP: Rs 132.36\n\nOn the weekly chart, Punjab National Bank is trending higher, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms, indicating bullish sentiment. It has also surpassed the multiple resistance zone of Rs 126 levels on a closing basis, along with huge volumes, indicating increased participation.\n\nThe stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMA, which reconfirms the bullish trend. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength RSI is in positive territory, which signals rising strength.\n\nTarget: Rs 142, Rs 155\n\nJK Cement| CMP: Rs 5,885\n\nWith a weekly closing, JK Cement has confirmed a past 6–7 weeks’ down-sloping trendline breakout at Rs 5,750 levels on a closing basis, indicating a short-term trend reversal. A bullish crossover of the 20- and 50-day SMAs reconfirms the short-term bullish trend. The daily and weekly strength RSI is in positive territory, which signals rising strength.\n\nTarget: Rs 6,200, Rs 6,450\n\nFor the past couple of years, UPL has been trending higher, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms, indicating a sustained uptrend. With the current close, the stock is approaching the “multiple resistance zone” breakout of Rs 820–830 levels. Any sustainable move above the same may trigger fresh upside momentum toward Rs 900–950 levels.\n\nThe stock is well placed above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMA, and these averages are also inching up along with rising prices, which reconfirms a bullish trend. The daily and monthly strength RSI is in positive territory, which signals rising strength.\n\nTarget: Rs 830, Rs 900\n\nOsho Krishan, Chief Manager - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One\n\nIDBI Bank| CMP: Rs 104.55\n\nIDBI Bank has experienced profit booking post the breakout over a multi-week resistance and has retested the neckline in the previous week. The technical structure remains robust, with the cycle of higher highs intact in the counter and the stock comfortably placed near the 20 DEMA.\n\nAdditionally, the SuperTrend parameter indicates a bullish outlook, and the recent correction provides an opportunity to reiterate bullish positions from a short- to medium-term perspective. Hence, we recommend buying the stock around Rs 102–100.\n\nTarget: Rs 118, Rs 122\n\nInox Green Energy Services| CMP: Rs 189.38\n\nInox Green Energy has undergone a corrective phase of nearly 30 percent from its lifetime high post the formation of an ‘Inverted H&S’ on daily charts, and with the recent plunge, the counter has retested the neckline. Simultaneously, there has been a ‘bullish divergence’ between the RSI and price action, that too at the neckline and the 200 DSMA, suggesting the initiation of a counter-trend in the stock price in the near period. Hence, we recommend buying the stock around Rs 185–180.\n\nTarget: Rs 220, Rs 240\n\nMishra Dhatu Nigam| CMP: Rs 357.85\n\nMishra Dhatu Nigam has demonstrated substantial consolidation near its significant EMAs in the last couple of weeks. Additionally, the counter is in a ‘symmetrical triangle’ formation on the broader timeframe and witnessed a volume spurt near the lower band, which has pushed the counter to a higher zone in the recent period.\n\nAlso, the technical indicators are strongly aligned with the price momentum, indicating a bullish outlook for the near term. Hence, we recommend buying the stock around Rs 350.\n\nTarget: Rs 385, Rs 400\n\nAnshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments\n\nTech Mahindra| CMP: Rs 1,670.5\n\nBacked by strong earnings, Tech Mahindra has broken out of a 46-week bullish VCP (volatility contraction pattern) structure near Rs 1,633, signaling a clear shift in trend strength. The stock closed right at the key resistance of Rs 1,684, highlighting this level as the immediate trigger zone. Volume expansion through the base and breakout confirms institutional participation, while rising daily and weekly moving averages underline improving momentum alignment.\n\nA sustained move above Rs 1,684 would unlock a sharper upmove toward the prior all-time high of Rs 1,756.85, which now looks more like a minor pause than a ceiling. Beyond that, the broader VCP pattern projects an extended upside toward the Rs 1,900 zone. Risk–reward remains favourable as long as the price holds above the breakout base, with pullbacks likely to be shallow and absorbed.\n\nHCL Technologies| CMP: Rs 1,698\n\nHCL Technologies has confirmed a decisive breakout from a 29-week bullish cup-and-handle pattern near Rs 1,695, marking a clear trend acceleration. The standout feature is the right side of the pattern forming a tight flag, adding momentum fuel for bulls. The handle also represented the first controlled pullback into rising 10-, 20-, and 50-week moving averages, which are now acting as a strong launchpad.\n\nBreakout volumes have expanded sharply, signaling institutional participation and conviction. The price structure across timeframes remains constructive, with risk–reward favourably skewed higher. As long as the stock holds above the breakout zone, follow-through momentum can drive an initial move toward the Rs 1,825–1,938 band. Failure to sustain above the moving average cluster would be the key invalidation.\n\nTarget: Rs 1,825, Rs 1,938\n\nForce Motors| CMP: Rs 20,565\n\nForce Motors has delivered a clean breakout from a 20-week rectangle formation near Rs 20,500, signaling a resumption of its primary uptrend. The consolidation was constructive, with the price resting firmly on rising 10-, 20-, and 50-week moving averages, which have now aligned to form a strong launchpad. The breakout structure reflects absorption rather than distribution, keeping trend strength intact across timeframes.\n\nVolume behaviour remains supportive, indicating steady participation rather than speculative excess. As long as the stock sustains above the breakout zone, momentum is likely to extend further. The immediate upside projection points toward the Rs 22,500 zone, where partial resistance may emerge.\n\nRisk–reward remains favourable while the price holds above the rectangle base, with any pullback toward rising averages expected to attract demand rather than trigger supply.", "company": "", "date": "January 18, 2026/ 23:37 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar"}
{"title": "Trump’s proposed 500% tariff may hit US consumers harder than exporters", "content": "US President Donald Trump’s proposed 500 percent tariff on countries that rely on Russian energy could raise costs for American consumers more than it hurts Indian exporters, as trade data shows the US remains dependent on imports from countries such as India for several everyday products, leaving few easy substitutes if duties are raised sharply.\n\nIn September, for example, India accounted for more than half of US imports in product categories worth over $500 million, equivalent to roughly 6 percent of India’s total exports to the US that month. In many of these segments, India’s grip is so strong that steep tariffs would almost certainly translate into higher prices on American shelves rather than a swift shift to alternative suppliers.\n\nTake household textiles. In non-printed cotton bed linen, India supplied nearly 59 percent of US imports in September, with shipments valued at about $66.9 million. In table linen, India’s dominance was even sharper, commanding an 81.5 percent share of imports. Packaging materials show a similar pattern: flexible intermediate bulk containers, saw India supplying close to 69 percent of US imports in the same month.\n\nThe policy backdrop to these numbers has added to the uncertainty. Last week, US Senator Lindsey Graham said that Trump had given the green light to a bill proposing punitive tariffs of up to 500 percent on countries that continue to import Russian-origin energy. The bill mandates that duties on all goods and services imported into the US from such countries be raised sharply as a deterrent.\n\nThe irony is that the US, along with the European Union, South Korea and China, was among the largest importers of Russian uranium in 2024, underlining how complex and intertwined global energy and trade flows remain.\n\nBeyond textiles and packaging, India’s dominance in some niche categories borders on a near-monopoly. In September, India’s share in castor oil stood at 99 percent. Several speciality chemicals and industrial inputs also show India controlling most of the import pie, even after the US imposed a 50 percent tariff on some of these items in August.\n\nFood products further reinforce how embedded India is in the US consumption supply chains. India supplied more than half of the US imports of prepared or preserved cucumbers and gherkins in September and retained a strong position in seafood categories such as shrimps and prawns in airtight containers, where its share was around 56 percent. In such products, supply chains are already built around a limited set of origins, making rapid diversification difficult.\n\nYet the data also carries a warning signal for India. Its dominance is not uniform, and in some categories it appears to be eroding. In hair products used for wigs, India’s share in September was about 51 percent, well below its roughly 76 percent share over the first seven months of the year. A similar pattern is visible in worked synthetic or reconstructed diamonds, where India’s September share slipped to around 69 percent compared with about 93 percent earlier in the year.\n\nIn some big-ticket categories, the fall has been sharper. India’s share in diamond imports dropped to about 22 percent in September from 51 percent over the first seven months of the year. In granite, its share plunged to 9 percent from nearly 48 percent, while in certain stone categories it fell to 31 percent from as high as 88 percent earlier in the year.", "company": "", "date": "January 12, 2026/ 20:32 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Ishaan Gera"}
{"title": "Vishal Sikka warns of AI valuation gap, urges Indian IT to evolve", "content": "The current valuations in the artificial intelligence sector do not add up, creating a significant gap between capital expenditure and revenue generation, according to Vishal Sikka, founder and CEO of Vianai Systems. In an interview with CNBC TV18, Sikka -- former CEO of Infosys -- warned of a hype cycle, noting that the economics of the massive spending on AI infrastructure are not currently supported by revenues.\n\nSikka explained the discrepancy by breaking down the numbers. He pointed out that while a company like Nvidia generates approximately $250 billion annually from its GPU sales, the total ecosystem spending, including CPUs, memory, and networking, swells this figure to about $750-$800 billion a year. To justify this expenditure over a four-year amortisation period, the industry would need to generate around $200 billion in new revenue. \"Where is the 200 billion? There is no 200 billion. OpenAI's revenue is 15 billion, something like that. And so there is a huge gap,\" Sikka stated. He questioned how long this gap would be funded, acknowledging that while one could call it a bubble, the current reality is that the economics \"don't add up to what has been spent.\"\n\nAddressing the impact on India's information technology services sector, Sikka asserted that AI is already capable of effectively automating well-defined, structured activities such as software development, maintenance, and business process execution. This means a much smaller team equipped with AI can perform the work previously done by a larger group. He urged Indian IT companies to embrace this transformation, even if it leads to lower short-term economic gains. The key to navigating this shift, he advised, is for these firms to become software companies in addition to being services companies. \"It has to be your own software,\" he emphasized. By developing proprietary AI platforms, IT firms can retain value even as the number of billable hours for projects decreases. This necessitates a business model adjustment away from purely people-based pricing towards fixed-fee, outcome-based approaches that account for the value of the software itself.\n\nLooking at India's position in the global AI race, Sikka expressed strong optimism, citing the nation's \"demographic dividend.\" He described AI as a powerful tool, much like others invented throughout human history, that can empower India's large, young, and educated population. \"The great mandate for us is how do we make all our people able to use these tools to build amazing things for themselves, for our country, but also for the world,\" he said. Sikka believes that if India can successfully equip its billion-strong population to use AI effectively, the country will thrive.\n\nFurthermore, Sikka called for greater participation in building foundational AI technologies within India. Dismissing the notion that the country has missed its opportunity, he compared the current stage of AI development to being in the \"first over of a T20 match.\" He expressed a desire to see a great foundation model built in India and highlighted immense opportunities for innovation. Future advancements, according to Sikka, lie in creating vertical foundation models for specific industries like healthcare, models trained on India's diverse local languages, and sophisticated \"world models\" that can understand the physical world and activities specific to the Indian context, such as traffic patterns and infrastructure.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 12:28 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Alpha Desk"}

{"title": "MC EXCLUSIVEIOB may miss August public shareholding deadline, seek extension, says CEO Ajay Srivastava", "content": "Indian Overseas Bank is unlikely to meet the minimum public shareholding (MPS) norms by August 1 and make seek more time from the government, managing director and chief executive officer Ajay Kumar Srivastava has toldMoneycontrolin an interview.\n\nSrivastava was talking to Moneycontrol after the state-run bank’s Q3 results in which the lender reported its highest every quarterly profit at Rs 1,365 crore.\n\nThe bank is planning to raise Rs 4,000 crore through a qualified institutional placement in the fourth quarter, which is expected to dilute the government’s over 90 percent stake by about 4 percent, he said, adding but even after QIP, the compliance with the 25 percent public float requirement will remain challenging, Srivastava said.Edited excerpts of the interview:\n\nThe December quarter profit at Rs 1,365 crore is strong. Is this the highest-ever quarterly profit for the bank?\n\nYes. The previous highest quarterly profit was Rs 1,226 crore and this quarter’s Rs 1,365 crore is the highest so far. Every quarter, we are breaking our own record and creating a new benchmark.\n\nIt has worked both ways. First, our income has increased. Credit growth is around 20–24 percent year-on-year, which has boosted interest income. Second, we are maintaining CASA at around 41 percent, which is a low-cost deposit base, helping us control interest expenses.\n\nThird, non-interest income has grown by around 18 percent year-on-year. This includes recovery from technically written-off accounts, PSLC sales, processing fees and other income streams.\n\nThe combined effect of higher interest earned and controlled interest paid has resulted in an operating profit growth of around 50 percent.\n\nThis profit was achieved despite Expected Credit Loss (ECL) provisioning. Can you explain that?\n\nYes. This quarter’s profit of Rs 1,365 crore is despite making an ECL provision of Rs 1,500 crore. This is the first time we have made ECL provisioning.\n\nIf this provision had not been made, the profit would have been around Rs 2,800-2,900 crore.\n\nGross NPAs have declined sharply to around 1 percent over the past four quarters. What has driven this improvement?\n\nA one percent drop may look sharp but it is the outcome of sustained efforts. There are multiple recovery channels — cash recovery, upgradation, sale to ARCs, SARFAESI, DRT and IBC. All accounts are run through these channels.\n\nWe have also created 16 exclusive ARNB branches across India dedicated solely to recovery. Aggressive use of all these channels has helped bring down NPAs.\n\nAdditionally, the denominator, credit outstanding, has increased. So, recovery on one side and credit growth on the other have together reduced the gross NPA ratio.\n\nAround 323 accounts were transferred to ARCs during the quarter. Were these corporate or retail accounts?\n\nThese were mainly MSME accounts and small-value accounts.\n\nOn the QIP front, what is the status of the Rs 4,000-crore issue?\n\nThe process is ongoing. Post the Rs 4,000-crore QIP, the government of India’s shareholding will come down by around 4 percent.\n\nAll approvals, from the government, RBI and exchanges, are in place. The appointment of merchant bankers is part of the ongoing process.\n\nWill the bank meet the minimum public shareholding norms by August 1?\n\nIt will be difficult to comply by August 1, 2026. After completing this QIP, we may explore additional options in the next financial year but it will still be challenging. If required, we can approach the government for an extension.\n\nWhat is the recovery plan for Q4, especially through asset reconstruction companies (ARCs)?\n\nWe had planned recoveries of around Rs 4,500 crore and are currently at about Rs 2,600 crore. We are budgeting around Rs 1,900 crore more.\n\nAll channels, including ARC sales, are being used aggressively. We conduct open auctions, create pools of accounts and invite ARCs to bid.\n\nRecovery is a continuous process. Many OTS (one-time settlement) cases sanctioned earlier have repayment timelines of six to nine months, so recoveries sanctioned in Q3 may come through in Q4. We are confident of achieving the Rs 4,500 crore recovery target.\n\nCASA ratio has declined year-on-year despite quarterly improvement. What is happening there?\n\nCASA percentage depends on CASA balances and retail term deposits. Our savings deposits grew by around 11 percent, adding nearly Rs 10,000 crore year-on-year. Quarter-on-quarter, CASA grew by Rs 5,300 crore.\n\nHowever, retail term deposits grew by 16 percent, or about Rs 25,000 crore. So, while CASA has grown in absolute terms, the faster growth in retail term deposits has impacted the percentage.\n\nPercentages can sometimes be misleading. In absolute terms, CASA has increased significantly.\n\nWhat CASA levels are you comfortable maintaining?\n\nOnly three banks in the system have CASA above 40 percent, and we are one of them. We have consistently maintained CASA at around 40-41 percent and intend to continue at these levels.\n\nGrowing CASA beyond this becomes difficult, as current accounts pay no interest and savings accounts pay only 2.5-3 percent. Maintaining 40-41 percent is a very decent level.\n\nCredit growth is strong, but deposit growth is lagging. How challenging is this environment?\n\nThere is a challenge. Credit demand is strong, while deposit growth is relatively slower. The domestic CD ratio is around 81-82 percent, which is still a tolerable level.\n\nHowever, if credit grows at 24 percent and deposits at 14-15 percent, challenges will arise. We will have to find newer ways to grow deposits.\n\nHow much rate-cut transmission has happened, so far, and what is the impact on margins?\n\nRepo rate cuts have an immediate impact on about 50 percent of our credit portfolio, mainly retail and MSMEloans.With 125 basis points of RBI cuts already delivered, interest income on half of the portfolio has reduced by that extent.\n\nOn the deposit side, we have reduced rates by only 40–50 basis points, as aggressive cuts would hurt deposit mobilisation. It is a delicate balance.\n\nDespite this, margins have not been impacted. NIMs are growing, and yield on advances is above 9 percent. We are finding ways to manage these challenges.\n\nWhat NIM levels are you targeting for the full year?\n\nFor the full year, NIM should be around 3.3 to 3.4 percent. We are comfortable within this range.\n\nEven if further rate cuts happen, we believe we will be able to protect NIM at around 3.3 percent.\n\nDid you participate in RBI's recent OMO purchase auctions?\n\nThe RBI announced liquidity measures under OMO for Rs 2 lakh crore on December 23, with 4 tranches of Rs 50,000 crore each. Bank has participated in all the three tranches of OMO for the tune of Rs 1,495 crore. Bank could not get any allotment in OMO due to undercutting from market level.", "company": "", "date": "January 16, 2026/ 13:28 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Manish M. Suvarna"}
{"title": "US clears path for Nvidia to sell H200s to China via new rule", "content": "The Trump administration moved closer to allowing Nvidia Corp. to sell its H200 artificial intelligence chips to China by issuing revised criteria for winning US government approval to ship the processors to Chinese buyers.\n\nUnder a regulation published on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said it will review applications for AI chip exports to China on a case-by-case basis, easing a previous US stance presuming denial of any request for permission to sell to customers in the Asian country.\n\nThe measure sets licensing requirements for Nvidia and AI chipmaking rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which is seeking clearance for sales in China of its MI325X chip. The stipulations include certifying that there’s no shortage of the processors in the US. Companies seeking export approval must show that production for Chinese customers won’t displace manufacturing capacity that could be used to produce chips for domestic buyers.\n\nThe companies will be constrained in how many chips they can ship to China, with a limit of no more than 50% of the total products made for the US market. Under the rule, overseen by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, companies must also “employ rigorous Know Your Customer” procedures to prevent unauthorized use of the technology.\n\nThe chips will also be required to undergo third-party testing in the US.\n\nIn a statement, an AMD spokesperson said, “We comply with all US export control laws and policies.” Nvidia didn’t have an immediate comment.\n\nThe regulation marks a key step toward carrying out President Donald Trump’s decision last month to let Nvidia and other chipmakers sell advanced AI processors to China. It represents a significant shift from policies imposed starting in 2022 to keep Beijing and its military from accessing the most powerful US technologies.\n\nIntroduced more than two years ago, the H200 would be the most advanced AI chip to be legally exported to Chinese customers. Nvidia sells its more-advanced Blackwell generation in the US and is preparing to shift to an even speedier family of chips named after the astronomer Vera Rubin.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 07:11 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Bloomberg"}

{"title": "Budget 2026: Confused about income tax slabs? Here’s a quick refresher", "content": "India is gearing up for the Union Budget 2026, to be presented on Sunday, February 1. Ahead of the announcement, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has begun pre-budget consultations with states and UTs.\n\nAs she prepares her ninth consecutive budget, here’s a recap of income tax slabs announced in previous budgets, and the current tax slabs under the old and new tax regimes.\n\nRemember, old tax regimes offer various tax deductions and exemptions, though the new tax regime is attractive for lower tax rates and a higher basic exemption limit.\n\nThe Union Budget 2020 introduced the new tax regime under Section 115BAC of the Income Tax Act, effective from the financial year 2020–21, offering taxpayers an alternative to the existing old tax regime.\n\nIn the Union Budget 2023, the new tax regime was made the default option, particularly for new taxpayers, unless they specifically chose the old regime. The Budget also increased the basic exemption limit from Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh and raised the income threshold for claiming a full tax rebate under Section 87A to Rs 7 lakh. Additionally, the standard deduction was enhanced to Rs 50,000 for both salaried individuals and pensioners.\n\nFurther strengthening the regime, the Union Budget 2025 increased the standard deduction to Rs 75,000 and raised the basic exemption limit to Rs 4 lakh.\n\nCurrently, the new tax regime applies as the default option for individuals as well as Hindu Undivided Families (HUF), Associations of Persons (AOP), Bodies of Individuals (BOI), and Artificial Juridical Persons (AJP) of all ages.\n\nTaxpayers choose to remain within the old tax regime to avail of over 70 deductions and exemptions under various sections of the Income Tax Act. Taxpayers who are enrolled under the default new tax regime can choose to return to the old tax system as per Section 115BAC(6) of the Income Tax Act.\n\nRates are generally high under the old tax slab as compared with the new tax regime. Taxpayers must carefully analyse their exemptions and deductions before choosing to return to the old tax regime.\n\nUnlike the new tax regime, which has introduced a fixed rate for all age-groups, the old tax regime has separate tax slabs for individuals up to 60 years of age, senior citizens (60-80 years), and super senior citizens (above 80 years).\n\nHere are the latest rates under the tax regime for individuals (Hindu United Family, Associations of Persons, Bodies of Individuals, and Artificial Juridical Persons), senior citizens and super senior citizens.\n\nSurcharge for Old and New Tax Regime\n\nThe Government of India imposes an additional surcharge on individual taxpayers, regardless of age, whose annual income exceeds Rs 50 lakh. Under the new tax regime, the maximum surcharge for individuals earning more than Rs 5 crore is capped at 25 percent, while the old tax regime levies up to 37 percent.\n\nWith Budget 2026 nearing, having clarity on existing income tax slabs is essential for effective financial planning. Taxpayers should carefully compare deductions available under the old regime with the lower rates and higher exemptions offered by the new regime to determine the most suitable option.\n\nRead more:Latest update on Budget 2026.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 18:21 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Dipen Pradhan"}
{"title": "MC EXCLUSIVENeville Tata set to join Sir Ratan Tata Trust as board meets on Saturday; no word yet on Bhaskar Bhat", "content": "A board meeting of one of Tata Trusts’ most influential entities — the Sir Ratan Tata Trust (SRTT) — scheduled for Saturday is likely to see the appointment of Neville Tata as a trustee while the name of   Bhaskar Bhat, the former managing director of Titan Company, may not come up for consideration at this meeting, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe proposed change reflects a broader convergence of views among key stakeholders on how trustee representation should be structured across the Sir Ratan Tata Trust and the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, Tata Trusts insiders said.\n\nEarlier, proposals had envisaged both Neville Tata and Bhaskar Bhat being inducted into the boards of SRTT and the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust (SDTT). However, under the revised arrangement that is expected to be placed before the SRTT board on Saturday, only Neville Tata’s name is being put forward for SRTT, while Bhat’s nomination has been dropped from that trust, at least for the time being,  these people said.\n\nBhat is one of the most respected professional executives within the Tata ecosystem, having led Titan through a period of strong growth and brand consolidation.\n\nNovember meeting fallout\n\nThe renewed focus on trustee appointments comes against the backdrop of unresolved issues stemming from the last round of inductions in November, when Neville Tata and Bhaskar Bhat were both cleared by the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust for appointment, but the parallel move at the Sir Ratan Tata Trust did not go through. At the time, the two trusts were meant to consider a common slate of nominees, including Neville Tata for a three-year term and Bhat as a professional trustee.\n\nWhile the Sir Dorabji Trust proceeded with those appointments on November 11, the Sir Ratan Tata Trust did not take up the proposals at its meeting that day after objections were reportedly raised by trustee Venu Srinivasan over how the items had been placed before the board.\n\nAs a result, neither Neville Tata nor Bhaskar Bhat was inducted into the Sir Ratan Tata Trust in that round. Srinivasan’s objections were first reported by Mint on November 13.\n\nThe development is notable because Noel Tata and Srinivasan had previously been viewed as broadly aligned during the internal disagreements that preceded the exit of long-time trustee Mehli Mistry.\n\nThe ouster of Mistry in Octoberfollowed a period of disagreements between the trustees. Mistry, supported by trustees Darius Khambata, Jehangir H. C. Jehangir and Pramit Jhaveri, had raised concerns over how information was being shared within the Trusts, according to people aware of those exchanges. Those concerns were discussed in Trust meetings held in September and earlier.\n\nVijay Singh, one of the trustees, was not renominated to the Tata Sons board after these four trustees opposed his continuation at a meeting of the trustees on September 11.\n\nSrinivasan was reappointed to the Trusts at the November 11 meeting, initially for a life term, which was later reduced to three years in line with Maharashtra government rules. That was the same meeting at which Neville Tata was inducted into the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Srinivasan’s position on Neville Tata’s induction into the Sir Ratan Tata Trust has led some insiders to observe that earlier alignments within the Trusts may now be shifting, though it remains unclear how significant that change will prove.\n\nThe Sir Ratan Tata Trust and the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust together hold about two-thirds of Tata Sons, making trustee appointments at these entities critical to the governance of the $350-billion Tata Group. The outcome of Saturday’s board meeting will therefore be closely watched for what it signals about the evolving balance of influence within India’s most powerful philanthropic and corporate trust structure.\n\nThe Tata Trusts did not respond to Moneycontrol’s queries seeking comment.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 16:43 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Deborshi Chaki"}

{"title": "US sanctions unlikely to deter Indian appetite for Russian oil, imports may pick up in January: Kpler", "content": "India’s import of Russian crude oil is expected to stay resilient in January despite the US’s proposed “Russia sanctions Bill” that imposes 500% tariffs on countries buying crude oil from Russia, according to global real time data and analytics provider Kpler.\n\nThe country is likely to import 1.3 million barrels per day of crude oil from Russia in January, Kpler told Moneycontrol.\n\n“If the proposed 500% US tariffs tied to Russian oil buying become credible, they would fundamentally change procurement behaviour, not overnight shortages, but a shift in risk calculus,” said Sumit Ritolia, Lead Research Analyst for Refining & Modeling at Kpler. “In January 2026, we see Russian crude imports around 1.1-1.3 mbd,” he added.\n\nKpler notes that beyond oil, such tariffs would primarily hit India’s exports to the US, creating uncertainty for trade negotiations and raising financing friction. This could even potentially push up India’s import bill and inflation pressures.\n\nThe country has ample physical supply options including Middle Eastern grades that would replace the bulk quickly, supplemented by US and West African barrels. However, analysts note that the real cost would be losing discounted crude resulting in higher average prices and a stronger focus on term contracts, diversification, and refinery optimization.\n\nAs per Kpler, India’s annual crude import bill could rise by $3–4 billion, assuming a conservative $5/bbl differential on 1.8 mbd of displaced volumes if Russian crude becomes inaccessible due to escalating sanctions or penalties.\n\nLosing this pricing cushion would not only inflate input costs but also strain fiscal balances if the government intervenes to prevent retail fuel inflation.\n\nThe country’s crude oil import bill stood at $80.9 billion during April-November of FY26, as per data from the government’s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell.\n\nIndia’s Russian crude imports fell sharply in December 2025, dropping to an estimated 1.2 mbd from 1.84 mbd in November, following new US sanctions on Russia’s major oil companies Rosneft and Lukoil.\n\nWhile this marks the lowest intake since late 2022, the decline reflects a short-term procurement adjustment rather than a structural shift, as per Kpler.\n\n“Russian barrels remain economically competitive and well-suited to India’s refining system, with volumes expected to recover from January as trade shifts to non-designated intermediaries. Absent broader secondary sanctions, Russian crude is likely to remain structurally embedded in India’s slate,” Ritolia said.\n\nRussian crude continues to find its way into India through an expanding network of intermediaries, traders, and logistical workarounds.\n\nWhile direct purchases from Rosneft and Lukoil have softened owing to US sanctions, alternative sellers including Tatneft, Redwood Global Supply, Rusexport, Morexport, and Alghaf Marine are increasingly stepping in to fill the commercial gap, Kpler said.\n\nFor Indian refiners, Russian barrels continue to remain competitive and marketable.  “Russian barrel imports are therefore expected to gradually re-normalise from January, albeit through more intermediated and less transparent structures, with the barrels themselves remaining competitive and marketable,” Ritolia said.\n\nAs per data from Kpler, Russian Urals differentials against Oman/Dubai on a Delivered ex-ship (DES) West Coast India basis have stabilised at a discount of around $7 per barrel since early December, down roughly $5/bbl from pre-sanctions levels.\n\nRitolia noted that this adjustment also reflects a broader softening in the Asian medium sour market, with competing Middle Eastern grades such as Arab Light and Basrah Medium weakening by $1.50-2.00/bbl over the same period.\n\nAs such, Russian barrels continue to remain very attractive for Indian buyers as the spread with competing Middle Eastern grades now reaches $8-10/bbl.\n\n“The financial gain is substantial for refiners willing to take the risk. India’s high-complexity refineries can replace Russian barrels by sourcing additional barrels from the Middle East, West Africa, the Americas, and North America, but often at the cost of margin compression, leaving Russian crude competitive on both price and refinery fit,” Ritolia said.\n\nLooking into 2026, India’s crude import strategy is expected to remain pragmatic and highly diversified, balancing affordability, security of supply, and geopolitical risk, analysts note.\n\nMiddle Eastern suppliers including Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE, and Kuwait will continue to anchor India’s crude slate, Kpler notes, while incremental volumes from the US and select Atlantic Basin producers will provide India flexibility.\n\n“On the demand side, new capacity additions—including the Rajasthan refinery start-up in H1 2026 and expansions at Panipat, NRL, and other complexes are set to structurally increase India’s crude import requirements,” Kpler noted.\n\nWhile Russia remains central to India’s crude slate, Middle Eastern, Latin American, and US barrels will continue to act as diversification buffers rather than full replacements, with Russian crude likely to persist through increasingly indirect channels as long as broader secondary sanctions are avoided, Ritolia said.", "company": "", "date": "January 12, 2026/ 23:22 IST", "category": "economy", "author": "Arunima Bharadwaj"}

The countryâ€™s second-largest software services exporter raised its revenue forecast to 3â€“3.5 percent from 2â€“3 percent earlier, citing stable discretionary spending and improved momentum in the financial services segment.\n\nThe rally in Infosys also lifted sentiment across the IT pack, with all 10 constituents of the Nifty IT index trading higher. The Nifty IT index emerged as the top sectoral gainer, rising nearly 3 percent to 38,851.85.\n\n\"Markets have received a boost from Infosys' results and commentary. With IT company valuations at attractive levels, there is buying interest and short-covering in the sector,\" Kranthi Bathini, director of equity strategy at WealthMills Securities told Reuters.\n\nAnalysts said Infosys is well-positioned to win market share through stronger AI partnerships and deeper client engagement.\n\n2) Positive global cues: Cues from global markets further supported domestic equities. In Asia, South Koreaâ€™s Kospi index was trading higher, while US markets ended in the green overnight.\n\nStock Market LIVE Updates\n\n3) Crude declines: Lower crude oil prices also aided sentiment. Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, slipped 0.24 percent to USD 63.61 per barrel. Declining oil prices tend to ease inflationary pressures and reduce Indiaâ€™s import bill, which is supportive for equity markets.Â Oil prices settled down around 4 percent on Thursday on easing concerns over potential U.S. military action against Iran, supply disruptions.\n\n4) India-US trade deal hopes: Investor sentiment was also buoyed by hopes of progress on an India-US trade deal. Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agrawal has said the first tranche of the proposed agreement, aimed at lowering reciprocal tariffs on Indian exports, was close to being finalised, though no timeline could be committed. He said negotiating teams from both sides were in continuous talks following a virtual meeting between Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and the US Trade Representative last month.\n\nFirst tranche of India-US trade deal near\n\n5) Decline in fear gauge: The India VIX, a measure of market volatility, declined 1.24 percent to 11.18. A lower VIX indicates reduced fear among investors and generally supports risk-taking in equities.\n\n6) Buying in bank shares:Strong buying was seen in heavyweight bank shares, ahead of the December quarter results by HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IDBI Bank and Yes Bank on January 17.\n\nOn the technical front, Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Investments Ltd, said support around the 25,600 level has helped a reversal pattern take shape in the Nifty. He said sustained trading above 25,715 would be required for further upside, with a potential target of 26,020. However, he cautioned that a slip below 25,600 could increase the chances of a decline towards 25,060.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

{"title": "GST cuts show up fastest in durables and automobiles as prices fall sharply", "content": "The latest round of GST rate cuts is showing up most clearly where consumers feel it fastest—on big-ticket discretionary purchases such as cars, two-wheelers and household durables.\n\nPrices in consumer electronics and automobiles fell sharply between September and December 2025, marking a far stronger pass-through than seen in recent years, according to an analysis of item-level Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.\n\nAcross items most directly affected by the GST reductions, average prices declined 3.6 percent over the September–December period. This is a stark contrast to the same months in 2024 and 2023, when prices in these categories barely moved, falling by just 0.3 percent on average. The data suggests that where tax cuts were deep and demand is relatively elastic, firms moved quickly to pass on the benefit to consumers.\n\nThe sharpest declines were concentrated in categories where GST rates were cut the most. Items mapped to an average GST reduction of about 7.8 percent saw prices fall 3.6 percent in 2025. In comparison, the same set of items recorded a marginal increase of 0.2 percent in 2024 and a 0.4 percent rise in 2023, underscoring how unusual the latest price adjustment has been.\n\nAutomobiles stand out most clearly. Prices of motor cars dropped 7.3 percent between September and December, while motorcycles and scooters became 4.6 percent cheaper. These are categories where GST cuts were substantial, and competition is intense, making it easier for manufacturers and dealers to reflect tax changes quickly in showroom prices.\n\nHousehold durables also saw meaningful relief. Washing machines recorded a 4.2 percent fall in prices over the three months, air-conditioners and air coolers declined 3.0 percent, televisions fell by a similar margin, and refrigerators became about 2.2 percent cheaper. Together, these moves suggest that GST changes are filtering through fastest in durable goods that involve larger, infrequent purchases and clearer price tags.\n\nThe picture is very different for everyday consumables. Even where GST rates were slashed sharply—such as edible items moved to the 5 percent slab from 18 percent—the pass-through has been limited. Candy prices declined just 1.8 percent over the period, while biscuits and chocolates saw a modest 1.2 percent drop.\n\nA similar pattern is visible in categories shifted from the 12 percent slab to 5 percent. Products such as coffee, bicycles, toilet soap, toothpaste and other toiletries recorded only small declines. On average, across 51 CPI items affected by GST changes, prices edged down by just 0.11 percent between September and December 2025. That compares with a 1 percent rise over the same months in 2024 and a 0.33 percent increase in 2023.\n\nEven within this group, the relief has been uneven.

{"title": "ANALYSISIndia’s exports pivot towards Asia, select European markets amid US tariffs", "content": "Indian exporters appear to be diversifying shipments toward Asia and select markets in Europe to offset tariff pressures from the United States.\n\nIn November and December, exports to markets such as China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Malaysia, Spain, France, and Germany surged, with growth in some destinations exceeding 60 percent compared to the year-ago period.\n\nThe US has imposed 50 percent tariff on most Indian exports since mid-2025, prompting an urgent need to diversify into alternative markets.\n\nIn December, shipments to the US fell 1.8 percent year-on-year but exports to key markets surged, with China up 67 percent, Malaysia 65 percent, Hong Kong 61 percent, Spain 48 percent, Vietnam 19 percent, Germany 9.8 percent and Belgium expanding 8.9 percent.\n\nExports to the UAE also grew during the month, reaching $3.5 billion, rising nearly 15 percent year-on-year.\n\nOverall, goods exports grew slower than imports to $38.51 billion in December, up 1.9 percent on-year.\n\nIndia’s top export to the US, engineering goods, which face steeper tariffs of 25 to 50 percent, also recorded growth during the month.\n\nThe total value of engineering goods exports stood at $10.98 billion, rising 1.3 percent compared to $10.84 billion in the same month last year. Pankaj Chadha, Chairman of EEPC India, attributed this performance to India’s growing export diversification into alternative markets.\n\n“Market diversification and policy support by the government have been among the key factors that have helped in maintaining positive growth. This also shows the resilience of the sector and the ability of the engineering community to adapt to emerging situations and navigate the challenges,” Chadha said.\n\nOther key exports, which are among the top ones shipped to the US such as ready-made garments, organic and inorganic chemicals and marine products, also held steady or recorded growth in December.\n\nMarine products surged nearly 12 percent; ready-made garments were up almost 3 percent, and chemicals rose slightly over 1 percent.\n\nTo be sure, exports of gems and jewellery and leather products slightly declined, showing that the growth trend is not uniform.\n\nThe country-level trade data for December is yet to be released.\n\nIn the first nine months of FY26, India shipped $41.65 billion to leading Asian markets, $53.88 billion to top European destinations and $36.69 billion to Middle East and North Africa countries, led by the UAE.\n\nExports to Oman stood at nearly $3 billion, rising 10 percent, Egypt at $2.7 billion, rising 21 percent, Sudan 71 percent, and Jordan 54 percent. Other MENA countries that showed growth include Morocco, Algeria, Qatar, Lebanon, Libya, Tunisia, and Syria.\n\nHowever, the trend is not uniform across all regions. For instance, in some European markets, shipments fell during the April–December period, with the Netherlands declining 21.2 percent and Italy down 4.1 percent.\n\nThe commerce ministry attributed the decline largely to lower exports of petroleum products.", "company": "", "date": "January 16, 2026/ 16:31 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Adrija Chatterjee"}

{"title": "Cipla stock crashes over 3% as brokerages cut targets on Lanreotide disruption, FY27 risks", "content": "Shares of Cipla Ltd fell sharply on Friday and extended recent weakness, after a series of cautious brokerage notes flagged earnings risks from supply disruptions in its key US product Lanreotide and intensifying competition in other generics.\n\nCiplastock dropped 3.48 percent to Rs 1,384.6 in early trade. The stock is now down about 4 percent over the past one year, sharply underperforming the Nifty 50, which has risen over 10 percent during the same period.\n\nThe decline comes after Cipla disclosed that manufacturing of Lanreotide has been temporarily paused to support USFDA remediation at its European contract manufacturing partner. Lanreotide is among Cipla’s top three products in the US and accounts for about $150 million in annual revenue, with the company holding a 22 percent market share in the product.\n\nMorgan Stanley maintained its Underweight stance on the stock and cut its target price to Rs 1,292 per share. The brokerage warned that the phase-out of gRevlimid and supply disruptions in Lanreotide are likely to weigh on performance, particularly in Q4 FY26. It trimmed earnings estimates by 2 percent for FY26 and 1 percent for FY27, cautioning that any prolonged disruption could result in market share loss and downside risk to FY27 and FY28 earnings.\n\nNuvama also turned more cautious, downgrading Cipla to Reduce and lowering its target price to Rs 1,360 per share. Nuvama said the expiry of gRevlimid exclusivity, uncertainty around Lanreotide supplies, and rising competition for Cipla’s proposed generic Advair following a recent approval for Lannett pose an earnings challenge for FY27. The brokerage noted that Cipla’s European contract manufacturer Pharmathen has temporarily paused production for remediation, with manufacturing expected to restart only in the first half of FY27, adding near-term uncertainty.\n\nCipla has said that the Lanreotide manufacturing halt is linked to remediation efforts following a US Food and Drug Administration inspection at Pharmathen’s Rodopi facility in Greece, which resulted in nine observations. The company has indicated that resupply of Lanreotide is expected to resume in the first half of FY27 and that it is closely monitoring supply levels.\n\nNot all brokerages are bearish. Nomura believes the potential loss of Lanreotide sales has largely been priced in, noting that the stock is already down about 6.5 percent since the issue first came to light earlier this month. Nomura has maintained a Buy rating with a target price of Rs 1,770. However, the dominant tone around Cipla remains cautious.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

{"title": "ICICI Bank shares crash 3% today even as brokerages bullish on Q3 results, view CEO extension a key relief", "content": "ICICI Bank share price fell as much as 3 percent in the opening trade on Monday after its Q3 FY26 results, even as the brokerages gave bullish calls on the stock. The stock fell to Rs 1,367 on NSE, down 3.1 percent from the previous close.\n\nBrokerages largely retained their positive stance on ICICI Bank stock after the lender’s fiscal third quarter results, looking past a profit miss driven by one-off provisions, while pointing to steady operating trends, stable margins and an improving deposit trajectory. The extension of CEO Sandeep Bakhshi’s tenure also emerged as a key positive, removing a lingering overhang on the stock.\n\nICICI Bank reported a 4 percent year-on-year decline in standalone net profit to Rs 11,318 crore in Q3 FY26, as higher one-off provisions weighed on earnings. Net interest income rose 7.7 percent year-on-year, supported by stable margins of 4.3 percent, while loan growth remained healthy, led by the corporate segment. Asset quality improved during the quarter, with the gross NPA ratio easing to 1.53 percent, though elevated provisions tempered overall profitability.\n\nAhead of the quarterly results,ICICI Bankshare price fell 0.4 percent on Friday to end at Rs 1,413 on NSE. The stock has gained over 15 percent in the last one year, outperforming benchmark Nifty 50, which has returned less than 11 percent during the same period.\n\nICICI Bank stock call: Brokerages bullish on growth\n\nBrokerages also pointed to loan growth led by the corporate and mortgage segments, improving deposit traction with a stable CASA ratio.\n\nCLSA reiterated its Outperform rating on ICICI Bank with a target price of Rs 1,700 per share, implying an upside of over 20 percent. CLSA said the Q3 profit before tax missed estimates by about 7 percent due to a one-time provision. Excluding this impact, the brokerage said the bank’s adjusted performance was largely in line with expectations. CLSA highlighted 4 percent quarter-on-quarter and 12 percent year-on-year loan growth, led by the corporate segment, while noting that margins remained stable at 4.3 percent. Deposit growth improved to 9 percent year-on-year, with the CASA ratio holding steady, and asset quality trends remained strong with improved slippage ratios.\n\nAlso read|HDFC Bank stock outlook: Brokerages bullish after Q3 profit beat\n\nJefferies maintained its Buy rating and raised its target price to Rs 1,730 per share, attributing the Q3 earnings miss to higher agricultural provisions and the impact of labour law-related costs. The brokerage said loan growth improved to 12 percent, driven by corporate and mortgageloans,while unsecured retail lending remained soft. Asset quality stayed stable, Jefferies said, adding that the two-year extension granted to CEO Sandeep Bakhshi until October 2028 provides continuity and clarity at the top.\n\nBernstein, which has a more cautious stance, retained its Market Perform rating with a target price of Rs 1,550 per share. The brokerage acknowledged that the CEO’s re-appointment meaningfully reduces an overhang on the stock; but it flagged a weaker quarterly performance. Bernstein said loan and deposit growth trailed broader system trends, margins were flat quarter-on-quarter compared with improvements seen at peers, and a one-time spike in credit costs hurt profitability. It also noted that earnings per share declined on a year-on-year basis.\n\nKotak Institutional Equities reiterated its Add rating and raised its target price to Rs 1,800 per share, noting that Q3 FY26 earnings declined around 4 percent year-on-year due to higher one-off provisions. Kotak said the extension of the CEO’s tenure until October 2028 removes uncertainty, while loan growth of about 10 percent year-on-year and deposit growth of around 8 percent year-on-year point to steady underlying momentum. The brokerage described operating profit growth as muted at about 3 percent year-on-year but said asset quality remained stable and the bank’s strong liability franchise continues to support its long-term outlook.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The recovery followed a firm 1.1 percent rise in the previous session ahead of the earnings announcement -- this suggests that some investors may have used early weakness to selectively add positions.\n\nAlso read|TCS stock outlook cautious after Q3 results; brokerages flag weak growth visibility\n\nHCL Technologiesshares also clawed back losses to trade 0.15 percent higher at Rs 1,670.1 by midday. The stock had fallen more than 2 percent in the morning trade after its Q3 results, despite a strong operational performance and a guidance upgrade, as brokerages flagged constraints on near-term upside.\n\nThe intraday rebound in both stocks points to stabilising sentiment after initial post-results selling. In both cases, analysts broadly acknowledged steady execution, healthy deal pipelines, and resilient margins. However, enthusiasm remained tempered by broader concerns around growth sustainability and near-term earnings momentum.\n\nAlso read|HCL Tech Q3 results review: Fundamentals improve, but brokerages cautious on near-term stock outlook\n\nFor TCS, brokerages highlighted muted international business trends, modest forward indicators, and limited clarity on a sharp growth acceleration, keeping most houses in neutral or cautious territory despite operational stability. For HCL Tech, analysts pointed to seasonality risks -- especially in the products business -- along with valuation comfort and historical post-results performance patterns as factors restraining near-term optimism.\n\nDespite the midday recovery, both stocks remain under pressure on a longer-term basis. TCS is still down over 24 percent over the past year, while HCL Tech has fallen more than 16 percent over the same period. The investor focus remains firmly on whether deal execution, demand momentum, and AI-led initiatives can translate into a more durable growth recovery.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

However, early-stage deals would rebound faster and niche and emerging sectors would gain prominence over the next 12-18 months.\n\nThe world's second-largest economy is slowing down. And that has sent alarm bells ringing around the world. In fact, if Nomura is to be believed, the downcycle has just started.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India's net forward position dropped by a massive $18 billion in June as the central bank went short on the dollar in the 1-month segment.\n\nChina sold a massive $94 billion worth of US treasuries in the year to July, data from the US treasury department shows.\n\nFaster adoption of external benchmark linked lending rate (EBLR) is expected to aid transmission of policy rates on to lending rates quickly and boost margins for banks.\n\nFY23 may be the year when Life Insurance Corporation's market share losing to private life insurers finally slow down.\n\nIndian consumers are more optimistic than before about the prospects of employment and income. But inflation is adding a layer of caution when it comes to spending.\n\nHousehold inflation expectations have moderated but only marginally and Indians are still worried that prices of food and services would continue to go up in the coming year.\n\nThe risk-off sentiment in global markets has resulted in outflows from Indian shores, puncturing valuations of listed firms here. This gives long-term investors an option to buy resilient balance sheets at a bargain.\n\nOn a cumulative basis, the pickup in rainfall was significant in July but the distribution was uneven. The month of August now holds the key for kharif output\n\nKey driver would be a sustained improvement in both quantum and dispersion of rainfall in the crucial month of August\n\nMoney supply growth has decelerated slightly on the back of a slowdown in bank deposit growth.\n\nLiquidity surplus is falling faster than anticipated but this fall is also uneven across the banking system, shown by sporadic borrowings at repo auctions and a consistent fall in standing deposit facility subscription.\n\nThe real effective exchange rate captures the competitiveness of the rupee against a basket of currencies.\n\nThe hunt for deposits would intensify among banks which could push up retail deposit rates further.\n\nEconomists expect that the festival season during the second half of the year would help in keeping the trend robust. The upshot is that tariffs are likely to see upside pressure.\n\nA recession may seem imminent in the US but signs of contraction are yet to show up on the balance sheets of banks there.\n\nCrude oil prices have come off sharply from record highs which is likely to have a favourable effect on inflation.\n\nSix months since the central bank vowed to reduce the liquidity glut, the surplus is reducing slowly.\n\nIndia’s imports from Russia outstrip exports and the trade deficit with the country has increased over the past two years. As of March, the trade deficit has more than doubled.\n\nSensex TodayBharat Coking Coal Share PriceMumbai BMC Election ResultsMaharashtra Election ResultsInfosys Share PricePune Election ResultsOld Tax RegimeNobel Peace Prize medalGold PriceAmazon Great Republic Day Sale\n\nBusinessMarketsStocksIndia NewsCity NewsEconomyMutual FundsPersonal FinanceIPO NewsStartups\n\nHomeCurrenciesCommoditiesPre-MarketIPOGlobal MarketBonds\n\nHomeLoans up to 50 LakhsCredit Cards Lifetime FreeFinance TrackerNewFixed DepositsFixed Deposit ComparisonFixed Income\n\nHomeMC 30Top Ranked FundsETFsMutual Fund Screener\n\nIncome Tax CalculatorEMI CalculatorRetirement PlanningGratuity CalculatorPetrol Price in IndiaDiesel Price in IndiaIFSC Code\n\nNews18FirstpostCNBC TV18News18 HindiCricketnextOverdrive\n\nAbout UsContact UsAdvisory AlertAdvertise with UsSupportDisclaimerPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyTerms & ConditionsFinancial Terms (Glossary)SitemapInvestors\n\nCopyright © Network18 Media & Investments Limited.

{"title": "Will Trump's 25% tariff on countries doing business with Iran be a negative for Indian markets? Here's what analysts say", "content": "US President Donald Trump has announced that any country engaging in business with Iran will face 25 percent tariff on any trade with US. Analysts have suggested what this can mean for Indian stock markets.\n\nIndian benchmark indicesSensexand Nifty have seen some pressure last year amid Trump‚Äôs tariff flipflops. The almost muted annual returns in 2025 came as Trump increased tariffs on Indian exports to US to 50 percent, citing New Delhi‚Äôs continued purchase of Russian oil.\n\nAmid Iran's biggest anti-government protests in years, Trump took to Truth Social to announce his new round of tariffs. \"Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America,\" he wrote.\n\n\"This Order is final and conclusive,\" Trump said without providing any further detail. No official documentation from the White House on the new round of tariffs has yet been released.\n\nIran, a member of the OPEC oil producing group, has been heavily sanctioned by Washington for years. It exports much of its oil to China, with Turkey, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and India among its other top trading partners.\n\nSensex dropped more than 545 points (0.65 percent) to 83,328, whileNifty 50fell 157 points (0.61 percent) to 25,632.90, as seen at 1 pm on Tuesday.\n\nFresh pressure on India?\n\nTrump‚Äôs decision to impose a 25 percent tariff on countries trading with Iran adds fresh pressure on India, which is already facing tariffs of up to 50 percent on several exports to the US. Together, this creates a potential tariff burden of as much as 75 percent on certain Indian goods.\n\nIndia‚ÄìIran trade stood at $1.68 billion in FY25, and mainly comprised exports of rice, food products, medicines, tea, and spices to Iran, while imports include chemicals and dry fruits, said Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza. He noted that while the trade size is modest, the concern is that the US tariff applies broadly to countries doing business with Iran, not just to Iran related goods.\n\n‚ÄúA key strategic risk is the Chabahar Port project in Iran, which is vital for India‚Äôs access to Central Asia. While the project currently has a US sanctions waiver valid until April 2026, there is uncertainty over whether it will remain protected,‚Äù the analyst further said.\n\n'A key macro overhang for Indian markets, but...'\n\nThe renewed threat of a 25 percent tariff by former US President Donald Trump has resurfaced as a key macro overhang for Indian markets, but its actual economic impact needs to be viewed with perspective rather than panic, said Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS.\n\nHe noted that while headlines suggest a broad-based disruption, India's direct export exposure to the US remains concentrated in select segments such as textiles, gems and jewellery, leather goods and certain engineering products.\n\nA potential 25 percent tariff threat on exports to the US is already being felt as it adds to trade tensions, which affect rupee weakness, especially in sectors that are more sensitive to exports, said Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director at Vibhavangal Anukulakara. ‚ÄúAlthough the Indian economy is more domestically oriented, stock markets related to exports can suffer short-term turbulence in stock markets due to the potential growth impact from tariffs. Investors will watch to what level of diversification can happen to avoid the negative impact due to tariffs,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúFor markets, the immediate reaction has been driven more by sentiment than fundamentals. Export-linked stocks may witness near-term volatility, but India‚Äôs broader market construct today is far more domestically anchored than in previous tariff cycles. Consumption, financials, infrastructure and services continue to be driven by internal demand rather than US trade flows,‚Äù Dasani said, adding that this phase will let investors distinguish headline risk from earnings reality.\n\nIn the near term, the impact should be manageable due to low Iran trade exposure and ongoing India‚ÄìUS negotiations, and over the medium term, a negotiated settlement remains the most likely outcome, which would limit market damage and reduce long term risks, said Tiwari from Bonanza.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 13:16 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Debaroti Adhikary"}

{"title": "SUV boom after GST 2.0: Tata Motors says India car market can grow 10% in 2026", "content": "Passenger vehicle sales in India are expected to grow around 10 per cent in 2026, extending momentum from GST rate cuts, with SUVs likely to witness accelerated demand, according to Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles (TMPV) MD and CEO Shailesh Chandra.\n\nThe company, which on Tuesday launched the updated version of its compact SUV Punch with prices starting at Rs 5.59 lakh, is looking to outperform the industry growth this calendar year with a slew of launches lined up, besides the full-year sales impact of models like the Sierra, and petrol variants of Safari and Harrier SUVs, Chandra told PTI in an interview.\n\n\"The first eight months of 2025 were a decline for the industry (passenger vehicles), whereas post GST (reforms), it has been upwards of 20 per cent growth. Even December was very strong. I hope January will be even stronger. So we are seeing that for four or five months these growth rates are sustaining in double digits,\" he said.\n\nChandra further said, \"Even if it stabilises a bit going forward, I feel quite optimistic that the industry has the ability to grow in double digit, 10 per cent plus minus two...\" He was responding to a query on the outlook for 2026 for passenger vehicle sales in India.\n\nWhen asked about the growth outlook for Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles in 2026, Chandra said, \"As far as Tata Motors is concerned, this is an intense (product) launch calendar (year) for us. I believe that we will be doing industry-beating growth.\" Elaborating on the company's bullish outlook, he said supplies are going to start this month for at least three products, including the new Punch, Sierra, as well as Safari and Harrier petrol.\n\n\"Then there are a slew of launches in this calendar year, so we would have a strong industry-beating growth,\" Chandra asserted, adding, \"After having ranked number two in quarter three of this financial year (in the last quarter of the calendar year 2025), we became ranked number two in VAHAN. So we have exited (2025) well.\" Commenting on demand trends in the PV market, he said post GST 2.0, SUVs have further grown better than cars. A lot of SUV sub-segments are doing well, including the mid-size SUV, compact SUV, and the sub-compact SUV segment, and these have driven the growth of the PV industry.\n\n\"So all three cylinders in the SUV segment are doing well,\" Chandra said, adding that the segment in which Punch operates would also see accelerated growth.\n\n\"This product (new Punch) will have the potential of definitely improving our sales, as well as expanding the pie for the sub-compact SUV segment,\" he said, adding that the sub-compact SUV segment has been the biggest beneficiary of GST 2.0.\n\n\"Post-GST 2.0, this segment has significantly picked up with the kind of price reduction that happened on the back of GST reduction by 10 per cent. Therefore, growth has tremendously come back in the segment, to the extent of nearly 70 to 80 per cent in Punch sales. Whereas before GST (reduction), this segment and the whole entry segment were declining more than the average decline of the industry,\" Chandra noted.\n\nThe sub-compact SUV segment, where Punch competes with the likes of Hyundai Exter and Skoda Kylaq, is currently witnessing cumulative monthly sales of about 40,000 units.\n\n\"This segment has the potential to continue to expand... At one stage, it would have been 20,000 (units per month), which went to 30,000 and now 40,000. I clearly see that on one hand, the industry will grow faster than what we had been seeing last year,\" he said, when asked if the sub-compact SUV segment can reach up to a total of 50,000 units a month.\n\nWith the new Punch coming with a strengthened value proposition, freshness, and contemporariness, along with more powertrain options, Chandra expressed confidence that the models \"will be a winner in the market\".", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 17:39 IST", "category": "business", "author": "PTI"}

{"title": "Budget 2026 expectations: Time to raise tax exemptions for senior citizens?", "content": "India’s 14 crore-plus senior citizens are entering retirement with rising medical costs, low interest rates, and shrinking social security support, yet their tax structure has barely evolved.\n\nWhile the government has consistently signalled a preference for the new tax regime due to its simplicity, the old tax regime continues to matter for senior citizens. Medical expenses, insurance premiums, and interest-based income make deductions and higher exemption limits especially relevant for retirees.\n\nOne long-standing concern is the basic exemption limit of Rs 3 lakh for senior citizens, which was last revised in Budget 2014. Since then, healthcare costs and everyday expenses have climbed steadily, eroding purchasing power for those on fixed incomes. Industry experts believe targeted tax relief, either through higher exemption limits or senior-specific provisions, is both practical and overdue.\n\nChanges in basic exemption limit\n\nCurrently, the basic exemption limit stands at Rs 3 lakh for senior citizens and Rs 5 lakh for very senior citizens aged 80 years and above. The concept of very senior citizens was introduced under the Finance Act, 2011, which also raised the exemption limit for senior citizens from Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh. Since then, these thresholds have remained unchanged.\n\nExperts say Budget 2026 presents an opportunity to correct this long-pending gap.\n\nVijay Bharech, Partner at Deloitte India says, “These provisions have remained static for years despite rising living costs. A revision in exemption limits would offer meaningful relief to retirees who rely largely on passive income and help reduce compliance burdens.”\n\nThe sentiment is similar across the financial services ecosystem. Narendra Bharindwal, President of the Insurance Brokers Association of India, says, “A calibrated increase in exemption limits is overdue, particularly for retirees dependent on fixed incomes and savings, and can be implemented without materially impacting the overall tax base.”\n\nUnlike the old tax regime, the new tax regime does not offer age-based exemption limits, which experts say creates an uneven outcome for senior citizens. Bharech adds that rationalising exemption limits across both regimes could simplify compliance while ensuring higher disposable income for retirees.\n\nKirang Gandhi, a Pune-based financial mentor, points out, “While the new tax regime offers a universal Rs 4 lakh exemption, it overlooks the unique needs of senior citizens. With higher healthcare costs and limited income growth, a separate, higher exemption limit even under the new regime could help ensure financial dignity in retirement.”\n\nSenior citizens aged 60 years and above can currently claim a deduction of up to Rs 50,000 on interest income under Section 80TTB. This covers interest earned from savings accounts, fixed deposits, and recurring deposits. However, experts say these limits were set at a time when inflation was lower and interest income formed a smaller share of retirement expenses.\n\n“Interest income continues to be a lifeline for retirees, yet the rules around TDS and deductions remain outdated,” says Gandhi. He adds that increasing the Section 80TTB limit to Rs 75,000 or even Rs 1 lakh would help prevent avoidable tax deductions that disrupt monthly cash flows for senior citizens.\n\nSeparately, the TDS threshold under Section 194A was recently raised to Rs 1 lakh, meaning banks do not deduct tax if interest income stays within this limit. However, Bharech, of Deloitte India, points out, “For many senior citizens who depend largely on deposit interest, Rs 1 lakh may still fall short of covering regular expenses.”\n\nRaising the threshold further, experts argue, could reduce unnecessary TDS deductions and ease compliance and refund-related challenges for retirees.\n\nMedical inflation in India is estimated at 12-14 percent annually, significantly higher than overall inflation. Senior citizens bear the brunt of this trend, making existing Section 80D deduction limits increasingly inadequate.\n\n“Medical inflation is running well ahead of general inflation, and senior citizens face the highest burden,” says Bharindwal. He adds that enhancing Section 80D limits, particularly for seniors, would be a high-impact and socially relevant policy move.\n\nThere is also growing support for allowing health insurance deductions under the new tax regime. Bahroze Kamdin, Partner at Deloitte India, says “Health insurance premiums, including those paid for senior citizens, should be eligible for deductions regardless of the regime chosen.” With medical treatment and hospitalisation costs remaining high and public health coverage limited, tax relief can play a meaningful role.\n\nGlobally, several countries offer tax incentives for healthcare, either through deductions or tax credits. Kamdin adds, “Extending similar benefits in India could improve insurance adoption while offering direct relief to retirees.”\n\nIndustry experts point out that if the government is encouraging a shift to the new tax regime, senior citizens should not lose access to medical-related tax benefits in the process. Bharindwal suggests, “A simpler approach, would be to introduce limited, senior-specific deductions within the new regime, particularly for health insurance or critical illness covers, without complicating the tax structure.”", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 18:30 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Priyadarshini Maji"}

{"title": "NPS Vatsalya Scheme update: PFRDA makes partial withdrawal, exit rules more attractive; check details", "content": "In a bid to make the NPS Vatsalya Scheme more attractive for its subscribers, PFRDA has made certain changes to the exit and withdrawal options under the scheme, designed exclusively for minors. NPS Vatsalya is a pension-linked savings product designed exclusively for minors, allowing parents and legal guardians to build a long-term corpus for their children.\n\nThe revised rules aim to offer greater liquidity and flexibility while maintaining the long-term savings objective of the scheme.\n\nPartial withdrawals allowed after three years\n\nUnder the updated guidelines, partial withdrawals will now be permitted after three years from account opening. This is a significant relaxation compared to earlier norms, giving families access to funds during genuine financial needs.\n\nAs per the finance ministry, subscribers can withdraw up to 25 per cent of own contributions (excluding returns) for specific purposes like education, medical treatment and specified disabilities.\n\nWithdrawal frequency revised\n\nThe revised rules also change the number of times partial withdrawals can be made. Partial withdrawals are now allowed twice before the subscriber turns 18 years and twice between 18-21 years, subject to conditions\n\nEarlier, partial withdrawals can be made up to 3 times until the subscriber attains 18 years of age.\n\nMore flexible exit options introduced\n\nAs regards the exit option, PFRDA has introduced greater flexibility. It said subscribers would have the option to shift to NPS Tier I (All Citizen Model or any other applicable model) or exit with up to 80 per cent as a lump sum, with a minimum of 20 per cent to be annuitised. Full withdrawal will be permitted if corpus is Rs 8 lakh or less, it added.\n\nEarlier, at least 80 per cent of the accumulated corpus available in the account must be utilized for the purchase of an annuity, and the remaining balance shall be paid in a lump sum.\n\nWhat is NPS Vatsalya scheme\n\nNPS Vatsalya was announced in the Union Budget for FY 2024-25 and subsequently launched on September 18, 2024, by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.\n\nThe scheme enables parents and legal guardians to systematically build long-term savings for their children from an early age, with a provision to shift to the National Pension System upon attaining majority.\n\nIn line with the amendments notified to the PFRDA (Exits and Withdrawals under NPS) Regulations, 2015, the NPS Vatsalya Guidelines lay down flexible provisions for long-term financial security of minors, while ensuring continuity of savings on attaining majority, it said.\n\nVishwajeet Goel, Head of Pensionbazaar.com, hailed the latest changes brought in the scheme. In a statement he said, “NPS Vatsalya’s updated framework is a commendable move by the regulator. By allowing flexible withdrawals for education and critical needs precisely when they are needed most, the PFRDA has addressed one of the most capital-intensive phases for any household, when a child typically pursues higher education.\n\nUnder the new rules, subscribers can withdraw up to 80% of the corpus as a lump sum between the ages of 18 and 21, and even 100% if the total corpus is below the ₹8 lakh threshold, significantly enhancing liquidity and financial choice for parents. This added flexibility makes NPS Vatsalya a far more practical tool for parents looking to invest in early savings for their children’s future.\n\nCoupled with the benefit of a lower minimum annual contribution and potential tax deductions on contributions, this product offers parents a powerful and flexible investment avenue that supports both long-term retirement planning and near-term educational or medical needs.”", "company": "", "date": "January 16, 2026/ 14:38 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Manisha Lal Khandpur"}

{"title": "Telcos cry ‘market failure’ at Navi Mumbai airport, urge TRAI to curb monopoly, cap infra charges", "content": "Private telecom operators have urged the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) to step in urgently, alleging a monopolistic choke point at the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. They have also called for a cap on in-building mobile infrastructure charges at public facilities such as airports.\n\nThe appeal comes amid a standoff over mobile connectivity at the newly operational Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA), where passengers have flagged the absence of cellular services since commercial operations began on 25 December. Connectivity remains unavailable as telecom operators and the airport operator have failed to reach an agreement on commercial terms.\n\nA similar dispute has also unfolded on Mumbai Metro’s Aqua Line, where commuters have endured patchy mobile connectivity for nearly three months after operators and authorities failed to reach consensus on commercial arrangements needed to roll out network services.\n\nThrough their representative body, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), operators have alleged denial of Right of Way (RoW) permissions and the imposition of an exclusive in-building telecom infrastructure at the new airport being developed and operated by Navi Mumbai International Airport Limited (NMIAL).\n\nIn a January 13 letter to TRAI chairman Anil Kumar Lahoti, COAI said NMIAL has refused to allow licensed telecom service providers (TSPs) to deploy their own networks within the airport premises. Instead, the airport operator has allegedly mandated compulsory use of a single in-building solutions (IBS) network deployed by NMIAL or its affiliate, on terms and pricing that operators say are commercially unviable and not cost-based.\n\nMoneycontrol has seen a copy of the letter.\n\n“COAI’s member TSPs, namely Bharti Airtel Limited, Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited and Vodafone Idea Limited, had approached NMIAL seeking RoW permissions to deploy their telecom and IBS infrastructure for provision of 4G and 5G services within the airport premises. However, contrary to the express mandate of the Telecommunications Act, 2023 and the RoW Rules, NMIAL has declined to grant RoW permissions to licensed TSPs,” S P Kochhar, director general of COAI, said in the letter.\n\nInstead, NMIAL has mandated that all TSPs must compulsorily utilise a network deployed by NMIAL or its affiliate, on terms unilaterally determined by it and at charges which are commercially not viable, Kochhar said.\n\nCOAI said the arrangement violates the Telecommunications Act, 2023 and the RoW Rules, which require public entities to grant RoW permissions in a non-discriminatory, transparent and time-bound manner. The association said it has been conveyed to its members that NMIAL is seeking payments of about Rs 92 lakh per month per operator—nearly Rs 44.16 crore annually for four mobile operators.\n\n“These charges are grossly disproportionate, bear no rational nexus to the underlying cost of related infrastructure, and significantly exceeds the capital and operating expenditure ordinarily required for deployment of an independent IBS network. Such charges are also prima facie inconsistent with the RoW Rules, which permit recovery only of reasonable operational expenses and restoration costs,” Kochhar said.\n\nBy leveraging control over the airport premises, COAI said NMIAL has effectively positioned itself as the sole provider of in-building telecom infrastructure, while denying competing licensed operators the ability to deploy their own networks.\n\n“This arrangement has resulted in a clear market failure. NMIAL/IBS Operator, though licensed only as a VNO, has assumed control over an essential facility, namely in-building access infrastructure within a public airport, thereby creating a monopolistic bottleneck. In the absence of competitive constraints and cost-based regulation, NMIAL/IBS Operator can impose excessive, non-transparent and noncost-oriented charges on all TSPs, who have no alternative but to accept such terms if they wish to serve consumers at the airport,” he said.\n\nCOAI has urged TRAI to examine NMIAL’s conduct, lay down and enforce a cost-based pricing framework with appropriate price ceilings for captive public locations, and issue directions to ensure non-discriminatory RoW permissions—or mandate shared infrastructure strictly on regulated, transparent and cost-oriented terms. It has also asked the regulator to take note of what it termed misleading public communications by NMIAL on network coverage and prevent attribution of fault to TSPs where RoW denial is the underlying cause.\n\nWarning that the issue is systemic, COAI said similar exclusive IBS arrangements are emerging across airports, metro projects and other public infrastructure, enabling monopoly rents unrelated to actual costs. Timely regulatory intervention, it said, is critical to prevent replication of this model and to safeguard competition and consumer experience.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 15:13 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Danish Khan"}

{"title": "Opening Bell: Sensex, Nifty fall in early trade today as Trump tariff risks cloud near-term outlook", "content": "BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty  slipped moderately in early trade on Tuesday, as investors turned cautious amid fresh geopolitical concerns and persistent foreign fund selling. The benchmark equity indices pared part of Monday’s sharp rebound even as global cues remained supportive.\n\nAt 09:33 am, the indices were down around 0.2 percent, with the Sensex falling 185.45 points to 83,692.72 and the Nifty declining 55.95 points to 25,734.30. Market breadth, however, was positive, with 1,873 stocks advancing against 1,072 declines, while 187 shares were unchanged, suggesting selective buying even as headline indices remained under pressure.\n\nThe muted start comes a day after markets snapped a five-session losing streak on hopes of progress in India-US trade talks. That optimism was tempered on Tuesday after former US President Donald Trump said countries doing business with Iran would face a 25 percent tariff, reviving concerns around the weaponisation of trade policy. India has been among Iran’s key trading partners in recent years, exporting items such as rice, tea, medicines and textiles, while importing dry fruits and chemicals.\n\nSectoral performance was mixed in early trade. Gains in energy, metals and PSU banking stocks provided some support, while IT, auto and consumer durables stocks traded lower. Volatility remained elevated, with India VIX rising close to 2 percent, reflecting lingering nervousness after last week’s sharp correction.\n\nOn the Nifty, ONGC, Tech Mahindra, Hindalco Industries and HDFC Bank were among the early gainers, supported by selective buying. On the downside, Larsen & Toubro, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, HCL Technologies and Bharti Airtel weighed on the index.\n\nGlobally, sentiment was constructive. Asian equities traded higher, while US markets ended at record highs overnight, supported by gains in technology stocks and easing concerns around interest rates. Crude oil prices edged higher as worries over Iran-related supply disruptions offset expectations of increased output from Venezuela.\n\nAnalysts say the Nifty’s ability to hold above the 25,650-25,700 zone will be crucial in the near term after Monday’s rebound. A sustained move above 25,800 could open the door for a further recovery towards the 25,900-26,000 zone, while a slip below recent lows may revive downside pressure. With Q3 earnings underway and geopolitical developments in focus, participants expect stock-specific action to dominate in the sessions ahead.\n\nInstitutional flows remain a key swing factor. Foreign institutional investors sold equities worth about Rs 3,638 crore on January 12, extending their selling streak to a sixth consecutive session, while domestic institutional investors continued to provide support with net purchases of over Rs 5,800 crore, helping cushion the broader market.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

It is India's leading logistics service provider for e-commerce express parcel and value-added services.

{"title": "Selling your house in February? Here's what you need to know about capital gains tax", "content": "Today’s Ask Wallet-Wise breaks down the schedule for capital gains tax due on a February house sale, the timeline for investing in capital gains bonds and whether to invest based on indexed or actual gains.\n\nAsk Wallet-Wise initiative offers expert advice on matters related to personal finance and money-related queries. You can email your queries to askwalletwise@nw18.com, and we will try to get a top financial expert to address.\n\nIf I sell my house in February, when does the capital gains tax become payable? What is the deadline for investing in capital gains bonds to claim tax exemption? Should the investment be based on the indexed or actual capital gains?\n\nExpert’s Advice: An individual is required to pay advance tax if the net tax payable, after adjusting for tax deducted or collected at source, exceeds Rs 10,000. In such cases, advance tax must be paid as per schedule: 15 percent by June 15, 30 percent by September 15, 30 percent by December 15 and the remaining 25 percent by March 15.\n\nFor capital gains, advance tax is payable in the remaining instalments falling after the date of sale of the asset. As the sale is proposed in February, the entire advance tax liability will need to be paid by the last instalment due on March 15, 2026. If this date is missed, the tax can be paid by March 31, though interest for one month will be applicable.\n\nIf you are a senior citizen with no income from business or profession, you are not required to pay advance tax even on capital gains. In such cases, the entire tax liability can be paid by the due date for filing the return, without any interest being levied.\n\nIf you plan to claim exemption by investing in capital gains bonds of specified financial institutions under Section 54E, the investment must be made within six months from the date of sale of the property, regardless of when the sale proceeds are received.\n\nWith indexation largely withdrawn, the required investment is based on unindexed long-term capital gains. However, if you choose to pay tax instead, you may opt to pay tax at 12.5 percent on unindexed gains or at 20 percent on indexed gains.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 10:46 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Balwant Jain"}

{"title": "The retirement traps that quietly undo decades of hard work", "content": "Most people think retirement planning is about one big number. How much corpus do I need? Am I on track? Can I stop working at 60? But in reality, retirement doesn’t usually fall apart because of one bad calculation. It unravels slowly, because of a series of small, very human mistakes—many of them made by people who have actually saved diligently for decades.\n\nTalk to enough retirees and you’ll hear the same regret in different words: “I thought I had planned well enough.”\n\nHere are the traps that most often catch them.\n\nTreating retirement like a finish line, not a new phase\n\nA lot of people plan as if life somehow slows down and becomes cheaper the day they stop working. In practice, the opposite often happens—at least for the first 10 to 15 years.\n\nTravel plans, long-postponed hobbies, family visits, and better healthcare all cost money. Many retirees are surprised to discover that their expenses don’t fall much at all in the early years. Some even rise.\n\nIf your plan assumes that spending will drop sharply the moment your salary stops, you may find yourself tightening your belt far earlier than you expected.\n\nA more realistic approach is to think of retirement in phases: an active phase where spending stays high, a slower phase later, and finally a phase where medical costs dominate.\n\nUnderestimating how expensive healthcare becomes\n\nThis is the mistake that does the most damage. Medical inflation in India runs far ahead of general inflation. Even people with decent health insurance often discover that large expenses still come out of pocket—non-covered treatments, room rent limits, consumables, or repeated procedures.\n\nWhat looks like “good insurance” at 60 can start looking thin by 70.\n\nMany retirees also forget that health costs don’t rise in a smooth line. They come in lumps. One hospitalisation can wipe out years of careful budgeting.\n\nIf your retirement plan does not include a separate, growing medical buffer over and above insurance, it is fragile.\n\nBeing too conservative with investments too early\n\nThe moment people retire, many move almost everything into fixed deposits and “safe” instruments. It feels sensible. The salary has stopped. You don’t want volatility.\n\nBut retirement can easily last 25 to 30 years. If your money grows slower than inflation for that long, you are slowly but surely getting poorer.\n\nThe risk is not just market falls. The bigger risk is that your money does not grow enough.\n\nA portfolio that has no meaningful equity exposure in the early and middle years of retirement often runs out not because of one big crash, but because of years of silent erosion.\n\nDepending too much on property\n\nA house feels like security. A second house feels like a backup plan. Many people count real estate as their “retirement cushion”.\n\nThe problem is that property is illiquid, slow to sell, and unpredictable in price. It also does not help with monthly cash flow unless it is reliably rented.\n\nPlenty of retirees are “asset rich and cash poor”. They live in valuable homes but struggle to fund regular expenses without dipping into savings. Property can be part of a plan. It should not be the plan.\n\nAssuming children will always be the safety net\n\nNo one says this out loud, but many plans quietly rely on children “being there if needed”. Sometimes they are. Sometimes they are not—because of geography, their own financial pressures, or simple reality.\n\nEven when children are supportive, financial dependence changes relationships in ways people don’t anticipate. A healthy retirement plan is one that allows dignity and independence, not one that hopes for rescue.\n\nIgnoring inflation because it feels abstract\n\nA 6 percent inflation rate doesn’t sound dramatic. But over 20 years, it halves your purchasing power. Many retirees budget using today’s prices and make only vague adjustments for the future. The shock comes when the same grocery bill, the same helper, the same medical tests cost two or three times as much.\n\nInflation is not a line in an Excel sheet. It is the slow leak that sinks most retirement plans.\n\nWithdrawing without a strategy\n\nSome people spend freely in the early years and tighten later. Others become so frugal that they never really enjoy the money they saved.\n\nThe real danger is withdrawing blindly—taking out money without any structure, without thinking about which assets to sell first, and without planning for bad market years. A poor withdrawal strategy can damage a portfolio even if the investments themselves are good.\n\nThe quiet risk of living longer than planned\n\nLongevity is a blessing. Financially, it is also a risk. If your plan assumes life till 80 and you live to 92, that is 12 extra years your money has to work. This is not rare anymore. It is becoming normal.\n\nThe most dangerous retirement plans are the ones that work perfectly—right up to the year they don’t.\n\nThe real mistake: not reviewing the plan\n\nThe biggest error is not a bad decision at 60. It is failing to adjust at 45, 50, and 55. Retirement planning is not a one-time calculation. It is a living plan that needs to evolve with health, family, markets, and goals.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is this: most retirement disasters are not caused by laziness. They are caused by reasonable assumptions that quietly turn out to be wrong. The good news is that almost all of these mistakes are fixable—if you spot them early enough.\n\n1. How much money is actually “enough” for retirement?\n\nThere is no single right number because it depends on your lifestyle, city, health, and how long you might live. A useful starting point is to estimate your annual expenses in today’s terms and assume you will need a corpus that can support at least 25 to 30 years of spending after retirement, adjusted for inflation. The bigger mistake is not the exact number—it is failing to review and update it every few years.\n\n2. Is it risky to keep money in equity after retirement?\n\nIt can feel risky, but having zero or very little equity exposure is often riskier over a long retirement. Since your money may need to last 20-30 years, some growth assets are necessary to beat inflation. The key is not to take excessive risk, but to have a balanced portfolio and a sensible withdrawal plan so you are not forced to sell equity in a bad market year.\n\n3. Can health insurance alone take care of medical costs in retirement?\n\nUsually, no. Health insurance is essential, but it rarely covers everything. Room rent limits, co-payments, non-covered treatments, and repeated procedures can still create large out-of-pocket expenses. That is why a separate medical buffer fund is just as important as having insurance.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 19:24 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}
{"title": "Daily Voice: Railways, defence capex likely to rise sharply in Budget 2026, says Spark’s Devang Mehta", "content": "Devang Mehta, the Deputy Managing Director & CIO – Equity NDPMS at Spark Capital Private Wealth Management foresees a significant increase in both railway and defence capital expenditure (capex) for India's upcoming Budget 2026-27, driven by ongoing infrastructure modernization, national security needs, and the government's focus on self-reliance.\n\nProjections suggest railway capex could reach Rs 2.7-2.9 lakh crore, a 10-12 percent rise, and defence spending is also increasing due to geopolitical pressures.\n\nMeanwhile, the December-quarter (Q3 FY26) earnings season is widely expected to build a strong base for subsequent quarters. He is optimistic that the current earnings season marks an inflection point after a period of market consolidation and valuation resets in 2025.\n\nDo you think the key factor to watch in the Union Budget will be the government’s strategy to narrow the fiscal deficit?\n\nThe government's strategy to narrow the fiscal deficit is indeed a key factor in the Union Budget, as it is central to maintaining macroeconomic stability and attracting investor confidence.\n\nLower deficit reduces government borrowing, which prevents \"crowding out\" of private sector investment and frees up resources for productive capital expenditure (capex). The government has consistently signaled its commitment to a glide path of fiscal consolidation, aiming for a target of 4.4% of GDP for FY26.\n\nDo you foresee an increase in railway and defence capital expenditure in the Budget?\n\nMarket participants foresee a significant increase in both railway and defence capital expenditure (capex) for India's upcoming Budget 2026-27, driven by ongoing infrastructure modernization, national security needs (especially along borders), and the government's focus on self-reliance, with projections suggesting railway capex could reach Rs 2.7-2.9 lakh crore, a 10-12% rise, and defence spending also increasing due to geopolitical pressures.\n\nDo you believe metals will emerge as a dominant sector in FY27? Do you see a potential entry into a commodity supercycle?\n\nThe outlook for the metals sector in FY27 is generally positive, driven by a combination of strong domestic demand in India, a global push for the energy transition, and supply-side constraints.\n\nThe global shift to clean energy, including electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels, and upgraded power grids, is creating significant demand for industrial metals such as copper, aluminum, lithium, and nickel. Gold and silver are expected to continue their strong performance into FY27, supported by ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, central bank purchases, and their role as a hedge against inflation and currency volatility.\n\nUnlike past broad-based super cycles, this one is characterized by \"structural divergence,\" where assets linked to monetary credibility (precious metals) and structural scarcity (specific industrial metals) are set to outperform, while others like oil might face a supply surplus and muted demand growth.\n\nDo you view the Trump narrative, rising US debt, and ongoing geopolitical tensions as the biggest challenges for equity markets, despite expectations of an earnings recovery and continued support from consistent DII inflows?\n\nMarkets generally thrive on predictability, which the Trump administration's policy shifts can disrupt. The potential for new tariffs (on items like semiconductors or all imports from specific countries) and trade wars creates supply chain uncertainty, impacts corporate margins, and can trigger significant sector volatility.\n\nThe rapid growth of public-sector debt and wide deficits in the US is a persistent concern for investors. While a US government default is considered extremely unlikely, concerns revolve around high debt levels increasing future borrowing costs, limiting fiscal flexibility.\n\nGeopolitical instability, such as the conflict in Ukraine, tensions between the US and Venezuela, and China-Taiwan dynamics, remains a major market factor.\n\nExpectations are a double-digit or \"mid-teen\" corporate earnings per share (EPS) growth for the fiscal year 2027 (FY27), a significant rebound from a muted FY25 and FY26. The sustained domestic support reflects a structural shift where the Indian capital market is becoming less vulnerable to foreign shocks and more responsive to domestic capital. While the DII inflows and earnings recovery provide a strong foundation for a positive 2026, a sustained, broad-based market rally will also depend on the eventual return of FIIs, who remain net sellers.\n\nAre you betting big on new-age companies that are expected to have a long runway ahead in terms of market size and opportunity?\n\nThe market is maturing, and investors are prioritizing companies that demonstrate a clear path to profitability and strong cash flow visibility. Profitable new-age tech companies have generally performed well in the stock market, while many loss-making are still struggling.\n\nWe like a number of sectors which are still small in size but have huge opportunity size. Along with this, we also like sectors where there is no perfect competition. This monopolistic, duopolistic or oligopolistic advantage leads to good pricing power, moat and superior ROE’s. Sub sectors of economy benefiting from discretionary consumption, finacialisation of savings including capital market plays and capital expenditure oriented proxy plays are preferred for long term wealth creation.\n\nDo you anticipate a major correction in global markets in 2026 if AI turns into a bubble?\n\nMarket sentiment is sharply divided, with the main points of debate centering on whether current AI investment is a speculative bubble similar to the dot-com era or a foundational infrastructure build-out.\n\nMany investors pinpoint persistent inflation as the most significant potential trigger for a correction. The massive capital expenditure required for AI infrastructure is driving up costs for chips and energy, which could keep inflation above central bank targets. If central banks are forced to hike rates to cool inflation, it would increase borrowing costs and reduce the appetite for speculative tech stocks.\n\nWill the December-quarter earnings season help build a strong base for subsequent quarters and the broader markets?\n\nThe December-quarter (Q3 FY26) earnings season is widely expected by analysts to build a strong base for subsequent quarters and the broader markets, supported by strong domestic demand, government policy support, and broad-based growth across several key sectors. Analysts are optimistic that the current earnings season marks an inflection point after a period of market consolidation and valuation resets in 2025.\n\nThe earnings momentum is expected to be fueled by robust domestic demand, falling interest rates, easing liquidity, and government initiatives like GST cuts, which have boosted consumption.", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 06:31 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar"}

These could be operated through a public–private co‑funding model with matched industry–government contributions.\n\n\"To strengthen India’s global integration, CII recommends enabling trade and exports through a simplified three‑tier tariff structure, with low tariffs on inputs and moderate tariffs on intermediates, to enhance competitiveness, integrate into global value chains, and promote export diversification,\" CII said.\n\nFinally, on the financial sector front, CII advocates a comprehensive strengthening of India’s banking ecosystem by enhancing the capital base of Development Financial Institutions, enabling selective NBFC‑to‑bank transitions, allowing calibrated foreign equity, encouraging the entry of well‑capitalised new banks, and consolidating weaker institutions to improve scale and efficiency.\n\nAn expert committee, on the lines of the earlier Narsimhan Committees, could be set up to reassess banking structures, ownership and governance norms, capital frameworks, and long-term institutional design for a future ready financial sector, CII said.\n\nAdditionally, to unlock liquidity and attract global capital, CII recommends accelerating asset tokenisation across real estate, infrastructure, and financial assets. “Building on RBI and IFSCA pilots, a National Asset Tokenisation Framework should define clear legal, regulatory, and tax provisions while standardising issuance and trading protocols,” CII said.", "company": "", "date": "January 18, 2026/ 23:29 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol News"}

But we cannot put a deadline, it is very near but we cannot put a date,\" Agrawal said.\n\nThe US has imposed reciprocal tariffs of 50 percent on most India goods, the highest in the world.\n\nBoth sides remain engaged and committed to securing a deal, Agrawal said, dismissing speculation about a scenario where talks could fail.\n\nA delegation led by Deputy US Trade Representative (USTR) Rick Switzer-led was in New Delhi from December 9-11 during which discussions were held on the framework deal as well as the broader Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA).\n\nIndia and the US have held six rounds of talks so far covering both the broader BTA and an interim arrangement aimed at lowering reciprocal tariffs.\n\nTalks for a BTA between India and the US first emerged in February, when during a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his American counterpart, President Donald Trump, the two leaders set a bold new target for bilateral trade, “Mission 500”, aiming to more than double total trade to $500 billion by 2030.\n\nAs part of this new goal, the two sides announced plans to negotiate the first tranche of a mutually beneficial, multi-sector BTA by the fall of 2025. While that deadline has been missed, India’s Chief Economic Adviser recently signalled that there should be an interim pact by at least March 2026.\n\nA trade deal between India and the US is crucial given that Indian exports worth roughly $48.2 billion are facing elevated tariffs.\n\nIndia also hopes that exports to the US will remain in positive territory, noting that electronics shipments, which are currently tariff-free, have been a key driver, so far, even as higher duties continue to impact other sectors, Agrawal said.\n\nExports to the US rose 9.8 percent year-on-year to $65.9 billion during April–December of FY26, government data shows.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 17:07 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Adrija Chatterjee"}

{"title": "India may resurvey urban slums after 15 years in 2027", "content": "The government is planning to undertake a nationwide survey of urban slums after a gap of over a decade, a move that could substantially refresh India’s understanding of living conditions in some of its most vulnerable urban settlements,Moneycontrolhas learnt.\n\nThe planned exercise, expected to begin around July 2027, will assess the physical condition of slums across cities and estimate the population living in them. It will be the first comprehensive survey of its kind since 2012, when the National Sample Survey Office conducted an assessment under its 69th round.\n\nWhat did 2012 survey say?\n\nAccording to the 2012 survey, India had an estimated 33,510 slums spread across urban areas, housing around 8.8 million households.\n\nNearly two in every five slum households were located in Maharashtra alone, underlining the scale of urban deprivation in the country’s most industrialised state. Andhra Pradesh ranked second, accounting for about 13.5 percent of slums and roughly 18 percent of the slum population.\n\nBeyond numbers, the earlier survey highlighted a structural challenge that policymakers continue to grapple with—the dominance of non-notified slums. At the all-India level, around 59 percent of slums were classified as non-notified settlements, meaning they lacked formal recognition from local authorities. While these slums accounted for a smaller share of households than notified ones, they consistently lagged on basic indicators such as access to drainage, sanitation, garbage disposal and formal electricity connections.\n\nOne household for every 1,000 had an electricity connection in non-notified slums compared with 111 for their notified counterparts.\n\nMaharashtra stood out not just for the scale of its slums, but also for their composition. The state accounted for about 23 percent of India’s total slums, but nearly 29 percent of all non-notified slums and close to 38 percent of slum-dwelling households nationwide.\n\nNew priorities, better targeting\n\nThe upcoming survey is expected to generate updated estimates at a time when India’s urban landscape has changed dramatically and government services have reached a larger population.\n\nSince 2012, cities have expanded rapidly, migration patterns have shifted—especially after the pandemic—and multiple central and state-level housing and infrastructure programmes have been rolled out.\n\nOfficials say that granular data would help design and target interventions effectively.\n\nThe earlier survey had also thrown light on uneven access to government schemes. It examined coverage under programmes such as the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission and the Rajiv Awas Yojana. Among notified slums, about 323 out of every 1,000 households reported benefiting from JNNURM. For non-notified slums, the ratio dropped sharply to just 180 per 1,000 households. At the national level, less than a quarter of all slum households were covered by the central scheme.", "company": "", "date": "January 19, 2026/ 06:50 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Ishaan Gera"}

Some additional deductions may be given to them,\" Garg has been cited in an interaction withANI.\n\nPointing to existing provisions, Garg said there is growing demand to raise the current limits on deductions for interest income from bank deposits and small savings schemes. \"A vast majority of individuals are saying this should be increased,\" he stated, noting that higher exemptions could help senior citizens cope with inflation and rising living costs.\n\nGarg said the Centre is more likely to fine-tune the new tax regime rather than announce \"path-breaking or huge changes\", partly due to fiscal constraints. One possible targeted measure, he said, could be the inclusion of employer-driven provident fund deductions within the new tax regime. \"Provident fund contributions are structured through the employer and do not require additional proofs. This could help bridge gaps between the old and new regimes without increasing compliance,\" he said.\n\nHe also flagged the standard deduction as an area where limited relief could be offered. “This is one area that can see some tweaks,\" Garg said, adding that the standard deduction under the new tax regime could be increased by Rs 25,000 or more, providing relief to salaried taxpayers without altering slab rates.\n\nOn tax rates, Garg said significant changes were unlikely. \"From a rate perspective, I do not see much change,\" he said, though he added that there could be \"certain tweaks\" on the surcharge front, amid demands for marginal reductions.\n\nGarg also highlighted the Centre's continued push towards digitisation and ease of compliance. Referring to the Annual Information Statement (AIS) and Tax Information Statement (TIS), he said that these auto-generated reports, available on the income tax portal, have made return filing easier. \"At least 50-60 per cent of the information is already pre-filled,\" he said.\n\n#WATCH| Delhi | Tarun Garg, Director, Tax, at Deloitte India, says, \"When we saw in the last few years the budget speech by the finance minister, she had clearly promised that there will be changes and a specific focus of the government on the digitisation and ease of…pic.twitter.com/mKNzWsSjCg— ANI (@ANI)January 18, 2026\n\nHowever, he cautioned taxpayers to carefully verify the details. \"You need to check whether the information is correctly populated, as errors or duplication could lead to the same income being taxed twice,\" Garg said.\n\nOverall, he said, Budget 2026 is expected to prioritise targeted relief and administrative efficiency over broad-based personal tax reforms.\n\nThe Union Budget for 2026 will be presented in Parliament at 11 am on February 1, with Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla confirming the schedule earlier this month.

Officials familiar with the discussions told the Times of India that IndiGo is expected to present a clearer picture of its readiness early next week.\n\nIt is learnt, as reported by the Times of India, that from February 1 the airline will begin planning crew rosters strictly in line with the new FDTL norms, without factoring in the temporary exemption that ends later in the month. IndiGo has already reduced flights for the remainder of the winter schedule, which runs until the last Saturday of March, and plans to operate its full network within these reduced levels under the revised rules. The airline is also unlikely to seek any further exemptions, the report added.\n\nThe aviation ministry and the DGCA are closely monitoring the situation. Sources quoted by the Times of India said regulators are determined not to allow a recurrence of last December's disruptions.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) has sharply criticised the DGCA's action against IndiGo, calling the Rs 22.2 crore fine \"peanuts,\" the Times of India reported. FIP president Captain CS Randhawa said the regulator's probe acknowledged disruptions only on December 3, 4 and 5, whereas the turmoil actually stretched until mid-December and was far more extensive.\n\nCaptain Randhawa also questioned the regulator's approach, the Times of India noted. He argued that issuing a warning letter after such widespread disruption undermined the seriousness of the violation. He further asked why the FDTL exemption had not been withdrawn despite flight cuts, pointing out that the DGCA can levy a penalty of Rs 30 lakh for each day of non-compliance with the new duty norms. \"Does this mean non-compliance with the law can simply be traded for a fine?\" he asked, as quoted by the Times of India.\n\nResponding to the developments, IndiGo said it remains committed to fully complying with regulatory directions. The airline stated that it is undertaking a detailed review of its internal processes to strengthen resilience and ensure it emerges stronger from the episode, while maintaining its operational record of over 19 years, the Times of India reported.", "company": "", "date": "January 19, 2026/ 08:10 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol News"}

{"title": "Cocoa gets cheaper but chocolate makers are still holding back", "content": "Cocoa processing remains under pressure around the world, highlighting continued demand destruction and struggles for the chocolate industry in the wake of record prices a year ago.\n\nThe amount of beans ground into butter and powder for confectionery in Europe — the top consuming region — likely fell about 3% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the average of 11 analysts and traders surveyed by Bloomberg show. That would be the lowest for a fourth quarter in 11 years. Grindings probably slid to a 10-year low in Asia, while rising slightly in North America.\n\nCocoa futures hit an all-time high in December 2024 following poor harvests in West Africa. The price shock prompted consumers to cut back on chocolate, and candy makers changed recipes to use cheaper substitutes and include more fillers like nuts. While futures have more than halved from the peak, they remain historically expensive and processors are still working through beans bought at much higher levels.\n\n“Demand destruction from elevated prices appears to outweigh seasonal support in the fourth quarter,” keeping grindings lower, said Priyanka Sachdeva, a senior market analyst at brokerage Phillip Nova Pte in Singapore. Asia should see the steepest year-on-year drop as it proves harder to pass on costs and discretionary consumption remains weak, she said.\n\nMost beans processed in the fourth quarter were likely bought before the sharp price slump, meaning the relief has yet to filter through the supply chain. Producers and analysts expect cheaper cocoa to only start feeding through to supermarkets in the second half of this year.\n\nCocoa products “are still very expensive” compared to levels four or five years ago, which will keep grindings depressed at least until the second quarter, said Vladimir Zientek, a senior trader at StoneX.\n\nWhile the recent price drop is expected to support a 1.2% recovery in global grindings for the 2025-26 season, demand growth continues to lag a recovery in cocoa output, according to Tropical General Investments Group analyst Nisha Kumari.\n\nWeaker demand and reformulating recipes have hurt prices of cocoa butter, the moneymaking product for grinders. European cocoa processing margins fell below break-even levels in August and then reached the lowest on record in December, according to data from KnowledgeCharts, a unit of Commodity Risk Analysis. At such levels, processors typically curb investment and run rates.\n\nUnderutilized capacity in major processing hubs is also weighing on profitability, said Jonathan Parkman, head of agricultural sales at commodities brokerage Marex Group in London.\n\n“There’s so much spare capacity in the world at the moment,” said Parkman, who estimates a 5% drop in fourth-quarter global grindings. “We’re not looking at a big surplus because we’ve had a big recovery in production. It’s because we’ve had a big crash in final demand and changes in recipes.”", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 09:20 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Bloomberg"}
{"title": "Metals sink as China exchange told to rip put high-speed servers", "content": "Metals fell at the end of a dramatic week, as news of a Chinese clampdown down on high-frequency trading cooled sentiment after frenzied activity in mainland futures that fueled global price gains.\n\nRegulators have ordered bourses including the Shanghai Futures Exchange — the main metals platform — to remove servers operated by high-frequency traders from their data centers, according to people familiar with the matter. Copper, zinc and aluminum all fell in Shanghai, as well as on the London Metal Exchange, which sets global benchmark prices for the commodities.\n\nMetals markets roared higher earlier this week — with copper and tin notching records in London — amid a broad wave of investor enthusiasm for real assets. As part of that, there has been a big spike in trading volumes on SHFE over the past month amid bullish sentiment across Chinese financial markets.\n\n“High‑frequency trading disrupts the rhythm of the market and amplifies price fluctuations,” said Jia Zheng, head of trading at Shanghai Soochow Jiuying Investment Management Co. The latest measures could “lower intraday trading volumes and reduce volatility, but won’t change the market’s fundamental price direction,” she said.\n\nSHFE has told brokers they need to get equipment for high-speed clients out by the end of the month, while other clients need to do so by April 30, the people said. High-frequency traders locate servers as close as possible to exchange data centers to execute trades as quickly as possible to beat rivals.\n\nRegulatory suspicion around high-frequency trading in China is not new and reflects a wider approach by authorities that seeks to manage volatility in futures markets. Officials have threatened to hike fees for high-frequency traders, although so far they haven’t done so.\n\nMetals prices were broadly steadying already on Thursday after powerful gains at the start of 2026. Tin was up 35% year-to-date at one stage this week, while copper surged to a record above $13,000 a ton, meeting bullish expectations. The all-in LMEX Index of six base metals rose just to short of a record on Wednesday.\n\nStill, high metals prices risk putting off buyers, and there have already been signs of pushback in the key market of China, where physical demand has been relatively week. Expensive materials can also prompt manufacturers to switch to alternatives, as shown by makers of solar panels trying to substitute silver after its price spike.\n\nFor copper, a major uncertainty remains around US import tariffs this year, with the White House due to make a decision by mid-year. Traders have pushed big volumes to the US ahead of any levies, and analysts including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have said they expect global prices to retreat from elevated levels later this year.\n\nOn SHFE, copper closed the morning session down 1.2% to 101,330 yuan ($14,545), after an earlier gain of as much as 0.6%, while tin fell as much as 8.3%. All six main metals on the LME fell, with copper down 1% to $12,978 a ton by 12:59 p.m. Shanghai time, while nickel fell 3% and tin shed 2%.\n\nThe move to curtail high-frequency trading affects other platforms, including the Guangzhou Futures Exchange that hosts commodities including lithium, platinum and palladium. Lithium also fell sharply on Friday.", "company": "", "date": "January 16, 2026/ 11:51 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Bloomberg"}

Of these, the BJP secured 93 seats, while the Shinde-led Shiv Sena won 27.\n\nThanking the people, PM Modi wrote, “the dynamic people of the state bless the NDA’s agenda of pro-people good governance.”\n\nMNS's throwback rhetoric to the Shiv Sena’s early years, including slogans like 'hatao lungi, bajao pungi', did not woo voters, particularly in cosmopolitan centres such as Mumbai and Pune.\n\nIn a post on X, Amit Shah said the verdict reflected people’s confidence in governance focused on welfare and growth, and thanked voters across the state for their backing.\n\nAfter initially enjoying the backing of Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray, a rift in the mid-1990s prompted Gawli to form his own political outfit.\n\nUddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena (UBT) outperformed the Eknath Shinde faction in the BMC election, but failed to win the prestigious BMC election\n\nThe victory in the BMC polls has allowed Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to consolidated his position as the state’s most powerful political figure, even as the Thackerays suffer their biggest civic setback in decades.\n\nWhile the UBT is no longer the city’s dominant political force, its ability to stay in contention against a formidable combination of the BJP and the Shinde-led Sena represents a notable political achievement for Uddhav.\n\nThe result of the prestigious civic body election will have wider ramifications on the politics of Maharashtra, where BJP has steadly marked its dominance.\n\nVoting for the 227-member civic body, India's largest and richest, concluded on Thursday amid tight security.\n\nHere is the complete list results of all 29 municipal corporations in Maharashtra:\n\nAccording to data released by the civic body, ward number 114 in suburban Bhandup recorded the highest turnout at 64.53 per cent, while ward number 227 in south Mumbai’s Colaba area reported the lowest turnout at 20.88 per cent.\n\nGet the latest Pune PMC Election 2026 results, live vote counting trends and the full list of winning candidates here.\n\nMaharashtra BMC Elections Result live:Visuals from Shiv Sena Bhavan in Mumbai showed party workers celebrating as trends  indicated the BJP–Shiv Sena-led Mahayuti pulling ahead.\n\nAsked about the comments made by the jathedar last week on certain videos circulating on social media, Mann claimed they were fake or AI-generated, which “could be verified in any forensic lab”.\n\nSensex TodayBharat Coking Coal Share PriceMumbai BMC Election ResultsMaharashtra Election ResultsInfosys Share PricePune Election ResultsOld Tax RegimeNobel Peace Prize medalGold PriceAmazon Great Republic Day Sale\n\nBusinessMarketsStocksIndia NewsCity NewsEconomyMutual FundsPersonal FinanceIPO NewsStartups\n\nHomeCurrenciesCommoditiesPre-MarketIPOGlobal MarketBonds\n\nHomeLoans up to 50 LakhsCredit Cards Lifetime FreeFinance TrackerNewFixed DepositsFixed Deposit ComparisonFixed Income\n\nHomeMC 30Top Ranked FundsETFsMutual Fund Screener\n\nIncome Tax CalculatorEMI CalculatorRetirement PlanningGratuity CalculatorPetrol Price in IndiaDiesel Price in IndiaIFSC Code\n\nNews18FirstpostCNBC TV18News18 HindiCricketnextOverdrive\n\nAbout UsContact UsAdvisory AlertAdvertise with UsSupportDisclaimerPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyTerms & ConditionsFinancial Terms (Glossary)SitemapInvestors\n\nCopyright © Network18 Media & Investments Limited.

The state-of-the-art sleeper version of the Vande Bharat Express will operate on the Howrah-Guwahati (Kamakhya) route.\n\nThe launch of the Vande Bharat sleeper train is part of a series of major rail and infrastructure initiatives aimed at strengthening connectivity between eastern India and the Northeast.\n\nApart from the new Vande Bharat service, several development works are currently underway at the New Jalpaiguri (NJP) Railway Station, one of the most important railway hubs in West Bengal, to upgrade it into a world-class facility.\n\nUpon arriving in Malda, Prime Minister Modi interacted with students, railway staff and train drivers who were present to be part of the inaugural run of the sleeper train.\n\nThe Prime Minister is set to lay the foundation stone of multiple rail and road infrastructure projects worth Rs 3,250 crore, aimed at strengthening connectivity and accelerating development in West Bengal and the North-Eastern region.\n\nCalling it a \"gift\" to West Bengal given by PM Modi, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said that the projects will enable more IT hubs to emerge in the state.\n\n\"PM Modi is giving West Bengal a gift of more than one dozen new trains. The first service of Vande Bharat sleeper trains will start from Guwahati to Kolkata. PM Modi will inaugurate it. Amrit Bharat Express trains are going to run. Along with it, 101 stations are being reconstructed in West Bengal. Under this, the New Jalpaiguri (NJP) Railway Station is in the process of turning into a world-class station, with the addition of two new platforms,\" according to minister Vaishnaw.\n\nAround 1:45 PM, the Prime Minister will dedicate to the Nation and lay the foundation stone of multiple rail and road infrastructure projects worth more than Rs 3,250 crore in a public function at Malda.\n\nThe Prime Minister is set to visit Assam afterwards. In Assam, he will participate in the historic cultural event celebrating the rich heritage of the Bodo community called the \"Bagurumba Dwhou 2026\".\n\nOn January 18, the Prime Minister will also flag off 2 New Amrit Bharat Express trains between Guwahati (Kamakhya)-Rohtak and Dibrugarh-Lucknow (Gomti Nagar) with the aim of strengthening rail connectivity between the Northeast and Northern India, enabling safer and more convenient travel for people.\n\nWhile in Guwahati and Kalaibor, the Bagurumba Dwhou will feature more than 10,000 artists from the Bodo community will perform Bagurumba dance in a single, synchronised presentation. Artists from 81 Legislative Assembly Constituencies from across 23 districts of the state will take part in the event.\n\nThe Bagurumba dance holds deep cultural significance for the Bodo people. It represents peace, fertility, joy and collective harmony, and is closely associated with festivals such as Bwisagu, the Bodo New Year, and Domasi.\n\nThe Prime Minister will perform the Bhoomi Pujan of the Kaziranga Elevated Corridor Project (4-laning of the Kaliabor-Numaligarh section of NH-715), worth over Rs 6,950 Crore.\n\n\"The 86 km long Kaziranga Elevated Corridor project is an environmentally conscious National Highway project. It will feature 35 km of Elevated Wildlife Corridor that will pass through Kaziranga National Park, 21 km Bypass section and 30 km widening of the existing highway section of NH-715 from two to four lanes,\" read a statement from the Prime Minister's office.\n\nThe project will pass through Nagaon, Karbi Anglong and Golaghat districts and is expected to significantly improve connectivity to Upper Assam, particularly Dibrugarh and Tinsukia. The elevated wildlife corridor will ensure the uninterrupted movement of animals and reduce human-wildlife conflict.

{"title": "HCL Tech stock extends losses, falls over 2% after Q3 results as brokerages flag limited near-term upside", "content": "Shares of HCL Technologies deepened losses in late morning trade on Tuesday, slipping more than 2 percent as investors reacted to a largely cautious set of brokerage views following its Q3 FY26 results.\n\nHCL Techstock was trading 2.37 percent lower at Rs 1,628 around 10 am, hovering near the day’s low, underperforming a firmer broader market. The stock has now given up its pre-results gains and remains over 16 percent lower over the past year. That was also a key factor tempering sentiment even after a strong operational quarter. Broader market sentiment was positive, with benchmark indices NSE Nifty and BSE Sensex seeing moderate gains.\n\nBrokerages broadly acknowledged HCL Tech’s strong Q3 delivery, marked by robust deal wins, stable margins, and a guidance upgrade that places the company at the top end of the peer growth range. However, most analysts stopped short of turning bullish on the stock, flagging seasonality risks, valuation comfort, and historical return patterns as constraints on near-term performance.\n\nCiti maintained a Neutral rating with a target price of Rs 1,700, noting that while HCL Tech’s forward indicators and deal pipeline are stronger than peers, the current valuation leaves little room for sharp upside.\n\nHSBC and CLSA reiterated Hold calls, with CLSA highlighting that Q4 growth could turn sequentially negative due to seasonal weakness in the products business, a phase during which the stock has historically underperformed.\n\nAmong the brokerages, Nomura stood out with a Buy rating and a target of Rs 1,810, citing confidence in HCL Tech’s AI-led, services-driven growth strategy and expectations of margin normalisation in FY27.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

{"title": "Fighting about money at home? Here’s how to break the cycle", "content": "Most money fights at home don’t start with numbers. They start with tone. A comment about spending. A question that sounds like an accusation. A purchase that feels unexplained. Before long, the argument isn’t about the money at all — it’s about respect, power, and trust.\n\nThe good news is that money fights are fixable. Not by finding the “right” budget, but by changing how the conversation happens.\n\nSeparate the trigger from the real issue\n\nA fight may begin with something small — an online order, a restaurant bill, a forgotten payment. But what’s underneath is usually bigger. One person may be anxious about security. The other may feel controlled or judged.\n\nInstead of arguing over the specific expense, pause and ask what it represents. Is it fear about savings? Feeling excluded from decisions? A sense that effort or contribution isn’t recognised? Naming the real issue lowers the temperature immediately.\n\nStop having money conversations in the heat of the moment\n\nMoney discussions rarely go well when emotions are already high. Late at night, after a long day, or right after discovering an expense is the worst time to talk.\n\nAgree, in advance, that money conversations will happen at a neutral time. Not during a fight. Not as a reaction. When both people are calm, the same issue often sounds very different.\n\nReplace blame with transparency\n\n“You always spend too much” invites defensiveness. “I didn’t know about this expense and it made me anxious” invites conversation.\n\nTransparency works better than policing. Share numbers openly. Share worries openly. Most people don’t object to limits — they object to being controlled without explanation.\n\nWhen both partners know where the money is going, suspicion loses its power.\n\nDecide what needs agreement — and what doesn’t\n\nMany couples fight because everything feels like it needs approval. That’s exhausting.\n\nA simple rule helps: agree on a threshold. Below that amount, each person spends freely without explanation. Above it, there’s a conversation. This restores autonomy while protecting shared goals.\n\nMoney fights reduce dramatically when people don’t feel monitored.\n\nAcknowledge different money personalities\n\nOne person may be naturally cautious. The other more relaxed. One tracks every rupee. The other avoids spreadsheets entirely.\n\nThese differences aren’t flaws. They’re styles. Conflict happens when one style is treated as “right” and the other as irresponsible.\n\nInstead of trying to convert each other, build a system that respects both. Let the cautious partner safeguard the base. Let the relaxed partner ensure life isn’t reduced to constant restraint.\n\nMake goals bigger than the argument\n\nDay-to-day spending fights feel intense when there’s no shared direction. When couples agree on what they’re working towards — security, travel, children’s education, early retirement — small disagreements lose their edge.\n\nRevisit goals regularly. Not just numbers, but why those goals matter. It reframes the conversation from “you vs me” to “us vs the problem”.\n\nApologise for impact, not intention\n\nMany money fights escalate because apologies focus on intent. “I didn’t mean it that way” doesn’t help if the other person felt dismissed or unsafe.\n\nTry acknowledging impact instead. “I can see why that worried you” or “I understand why that felt unfair.” Feeling understood matters more than being right.\n\nWhen fights keep repeating\n\nIf the same argument keeps resurfacing, it’s usually not about spending at all. It may be about unequal mental load, income imbalance, past financial trauma, or unspoken resentment.\n\nIn those cases, budgeting apps won’t fix the problem. Honest conversations — sometimes with a neutral third party — will.\n\nMoney fights aren’t a sign of failure. They’re a sign that something important hasn’t been expressed clearly yet.\n\nHandled well, these conversations can build trust instead of breaking it. The goal isn’t to win the argument. It’s to make sure both people feel safe, respected, and part of the same financial team.", "company": "", "date": "January 17, 2026/ 11:01 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

{"title": "Women pay digitally, borrow better, default less, and still get less credit and cover, says report", "content": "India’s women are increasingly powering the shift to digital finance, yet remain underserved across key financial products. Women now make up 47 percent of the country’s internet users, up from 20 percent in 2014, and their digital payment usage has nearly doubled from 22 percent in FY15 to 42 percent in FY25E, compared with 35 percent to 49 percent among men, according to Redseer data.\n\nThe report by the management consulting firm further indicated that, despite improved digital adoption, with women now comprising 200 million users, they remain underserved across key financial products in India, including credit, investments, savings, and insurance, in terms of both volume and value.\n\n“Our report shows the next phase of growth will come from closing relevance and representation gaps for women. BFSI communication remains largely male-centric or gender agnostic, with women visible but rarely portrayed as primary decision makers,” said Jasbir S. Juneja, Partner, Redseer Strategy Consultants.\n\nAs of December 2024, women make up only 17 percent of active personalloans,13 percent of outstanding credit card portfolios, and 22 percent of consumer durable loans. In wealth and long-term savings, they hold 23 percent of mutual fund AUM (February 2024), account for 27 percent of new EPF subscriptions (2024-25), and represent just 34 percent of new insurance policies (March 2023), the data showed.\n\nAlthough women constitute a high-growth opportunity segment for financial products and services, they represent a low-risk, high-quality, and fast-growing financial cohort, the report argues.\n\nPrime and above women borrowers constitute 66 percent versus 60 percent of men (CY24E), and delinquencies are lower at 1.6 percent versus 2.2 percent (December 2024). Their average mutual fund folio size also grew from Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh, representing 18.4 percent versus men’s 11.6 percent rise (CY19 to CY24).\n\nAccording to Juneja, \"This imbalance is reinforced by who sells and who influences financial decisions, wherein men make up 71% of insurance advisors, appear in nearly 80% of testimonials on leading fintech platforms, and account for 14 of the top 15 finance YouTubers.\"\n\nThe report notes that India’s roughly 75 million working women in the labour force as of FY25 represent a large, underserved opportunity for the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector. By income, around 3.7 million are high earners (above Rs 25 lakh), 7.4 million are upper-middle income (Rs 10–20 lakh), 14.8 million earn Rs 5–10 lakh, 22.2 million earn Rs 2–5 lakh, and the largest group of about 25.9 million earns up to Rs 2 lakh a year.\n\nTailored financial solutions for women, with women-first product design and distribution, could unlock untapped potential for BFSI opportunities across investments, lending and insurance, the report argues.\n\nThe biggest prize is in investment, with AUM of around Rs 2,00,000 billion across mutual funds or SIPS, fixed deposits, stocks, and digital gold. Followed by lending with an AUM of about Rs 67,000 billion across credit cards and retail loans, while insurance can offer roughly Rs 17,000 billion across term, health, and general insurance.\n\n“Women’s needs are also clear and often mismatched, as many seek flexibility and clarity but are offered rigid, long-term, lock-in heavy products. The strongest blueprint is already visible in community-led models like SHGs and initiatives such as Digital Sakhi, and the opportunity now is to reframe journeys around real-life goals and social validation,” said Juneja.", "company": "", "date": "January 16, 2026/ 17:51 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Dipen Pradhan"}

{"title": "Technical View: Breakdown below 25,600 may deepen Nifty selling; 59,800 crucial for further upside in Bank Nifty", "content": "The Nifty 50 continued to show consolidation and closed one-third of a percent lower with above-average volumes on January 14, extending weakness for another session. The index remained between the 100-day EMA and 50-day EMA and also held above 25,600 on a closing basis for the fourth straight session. This suggests that a break of the 25,600‚Äì25,900 range on either side could give a firm direction to the index in the next few sessions, as the index awaits more quarterly earnings scheduled in the coming weeks.\n\nIf the index decisively breaks 25,600, 25,450 will be the immediate level to watch, followed by 25,300. However, on the higher side, 26,000‚Äì26,200 can be possible if it breaks out above 25,900, experts said.\n\nAfter opening weak, the Nifty 50 showed recovery and climbed near 25,800 but could not sustain those gains in the afternoon and remained under pressure for the remaining part of the session. It finished at 25,666, down 67 points (0.26 percent), and formed a small green candle with a long upper shadow on the daily timeframe, indicating narrow-range movement in the market within the 25,900‚Äì25,600 levels along with volatility.\n\nAccording to Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, the underlying trend of the Nifty continues to be choppy with a weak bias. ‚ÄúA sustainable move only above the 25,900‚Äì26,000 levels could open more sustainable upside in the market. Any failure to sustain could result in the Nifty retesting the lows of around 25,500‚Äì25,400 levels in the next few sessions,‚Äù he said.\n\nThe weekly options data continued to suggest a broad trading range of 25,000‚Äì26,000 for the Nifty 50. The maximum Call open interest remained at the 26,000 strike, followed by the 25,800 and 26,500 strikes, with maximum Call writing at the 26,000, 26,400, and 25,800 strikes. On the Put side, the 25,000 strike held the maximum Put open interest, followed by the 25,600 and 25,500 strikes, with maximum Put writing at the 25,000, 25,600, and 25,500 strikes.\n\nThe market will remain shut on January 15 for MCGM Election day.\n\nThe Bank Nifty largely traded within the previous day‚Äôs range and closed flat with a positive bias at 59,580 amid above-average volumes, after hitting a day‚Äôs high near 59,800 (a key level for further upside) and a low near 59,300 (an immediate support). The index formed a bullish candle with an upper shadow on the daily charts, indicating a positive trend despite pressure at higher levels.\n\nIn fact, the higher high‚Äìhigher low formation continued, with the banking index sustaining above the 50-day EMA and the midline of Bollinger Bands, as well as consolidating above support trendlines, which is a structurally positive setup.\n\nOn the momentum indicators front, the RSI inched slightly higher to 53.55, though it remained below the signal line, indicating a lack of strong buying momentum. The MACD also sustained below the reference line with further weakness in the histogram, while the Stochastic RSI showed a positive crossover near lower zones. All this indicates mixed momentum signals in the near term.\n\n‚ÄúThe index is expected to regain momentum once it decisively reclaims the 59,800 level. Until then, the index is likely to trade in a broad range of 59,000‚Äì59,800, where 59,200‚Äì59,150 acts as a crucial support zone near the 50-day SMA, while 59,800 will continue to act as the immediate range resistance,‚Äù said Vatsal Bhuva, Technical Analyst at LKP Securities.\n\nMeanwhile, the India VIX, also known as the fear gauge, moved within a narrow range of 11.47‚Äì11.01 before closing higher at 11.32, up 1.09 percent. In fact, the daily range has been reducing since yesterday; hence, a sharp move on either side cannot be ruled out. Overall, it remained above key moving averages (except the 200-day EMA), which signals caution for bulls.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 17:01 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar"}

{"title": "FTAs, not tariffs are the bigger picture for Indian markets: Elara Capital’s Harendra Kumar", "content": "India's equity markets are overly focused on tariffs, while missing a much larger structural shift underway through Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), said Harendra Kumar, MD- Institutional Equities, Elara Capital, arguing that FTAs will drive India’s next phase of growth.\n\nIn 2025, India signed a series of key trade agreements to expand market access for its exports. The India–UK Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), signed in July 2025, and the India–Oman Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) in December 2025 and India-New Zealand FTA.\n\n“Tariffs are largely a non-event for India,” Kumar said. “Only a small portion of India’s exports to the US are impacted, and those have already been repriced by the market. At best, tariffs will be revised downward, which actually becomes a marginal positive by removing uncertainty.”\n\nAccording to Kumar, the real story lies in India’s aggressive push toward FTAs, marking the country’s biggest reform movement since the 1990s. “India is fundamentally changing its geo-economic strategy by opening its markets, reducing trade barriers, and encouraging two-way trade. This shift is being underestimated by markets,” he said.\n\nHe noted that while India can sustain 7% growth through domestic drivers, achieving 9% growth will require a strong export engine, something FTAs are designed to unlock. “FTAs will enable India to transition from an agri- and services-led economy to one with a much larger manufacturing export component,” Kumar said.\n\nMarket yet to fully price in FTAs\n\nKumar acknowledged that markets have partially reacted to FTAs, citing early rallies in textiles and select export-oriented sectors. However, he said the broader impact has not been fully priced in due to the gradual and staggered nature of trade negotiations.\n\n“Markets dislike ambiguity and long gestation periods. Once the US tariff overhang clears, attention will shift back to FTAs and we will see a repricing,” he said.\n\nHe expects the initial impact of FTAs to come from utilization of surplus capacity at export-oriented companies, estimating that 25–30% of existing capacity could be absorbed quickly once agreements are fully notified and implemented. This would be followed by fresh capacity creation in sectors where demand strengthens.\n\nKey Beneficiaries: Textiles, Footwear, Gems & Jewellery\n\nAmong sectors poised to benefit, Kumar highlighted textiles, footwear, gems and jewellery, aquaculture, and fisheries. He said India had previously missed the textile opportunity after China exited the space, with Bangladesh gaining ground due to India’s policy constraints but that could change.", "company": "", "date": "January 16, 2026/ 06:50 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Anishaa Kumar"}

{"title": "Ahead of Budget 2026, real estate sector pushes for industry status, faster approvals, land digitisation", "content": "As the Union Budget 2026 draws near, India’s real estate sector has urged the government to grant the sector an industry status, digitise land records and introduce a simplified single-window clearance mechanism to accelerate approvals and revive demand.\n\nIndustry bodies and developers argue that recognising real estate as an “industry” would unlock cheaper long-term institutional credit, lower borrowing costs and broader access to structured financing.\n\nDevelopers said that industry status has been a long-pending demand and they remain optimistic, expecting sustained policy support in the budget.\n\n“The real estate sector currently contributes around 7 percent to India’s GDP and supports over 200 allied industries. Granting industry status to real estate sector would improve access to institutional funding and enable the sector to play a stronger role in job creation and economic growth. Real estate has the potential to contribute up to 15 percent to India’s GDP by 2047 with the help of adequate policy support,”Signature Global (India) Ltdfounder and chairman Pradeep Aggarwal has said.\n\nTribeca Developers group CEO Rajat Khandelwal said the sector is looking for policy continuity that supports both supply and demand. “Granting industry status to real estate remains crucial, as it would ease access to long-term capital; lower borrowing costs, and improve execution efficiency for developers,” he said.\n\nKhandelwal said real estate growth is closely tied to infrastructure. Increased investments in urban infrastructure, public transport and smart city initiatives will not only make cities liveable but also strengthen the realty sector.\n\nSterling Developers chairman and managing director Ramani Sastri said industry status will help the real estate sector realise its full potential, as it will unlock affordable funding and streamline regulatory processes.\n\n“Overall, we would like to see announcements to enhance ease of doing business for the developers to create positive climate for real estate investment,” he said.\n\nSingle-window clearance and digitisation of land records\n\nDevelopers have also sought single-window clearances, consolidating approvals from multiple authorities on a unified digital platform.

{"title": "Budget 2026: How can FM make the new tax regime more attractive?", "content": "The New Tax Regime has come a long way from being a confusing alternative to becoming the default choice for many taxpayers. After Budget 2025 widened tax slabs and raised rebates, the simplified regime finally began to look rewarding, not just convenient. With more taxpayers expected to opt for it while filing returns this year, the focus has now shifted to the next big question: what can Budget 2026 do to make it even more appealing?\n\nDespite the government’s clear push towards a cleaner, deduction-free system, the old tax regime hasn’t lost its relevance entirely. For senior citizens, expenses such as healthcare, insurance, and interest-driven income still make deductions and higher exemption limits hard to ignore. As Budget 2026 approaches, expectations are building around whether the Finance Minister can fine-tune the new regime without leaving key taxpayer groups behind.\n\nIntroduce Select Deductions to Improve Practicality\n\nOne of the biggest gaps in the new tax regime is the absence of commonly used deductions. At present, taxpayers can claim only the standard deduction and employer contributions to NPS, while benefits such as HRA and medical insurance remain unavailable.\n\nExperts say reintroducing a small set of essential deductions could make the regime more workable without undoing its core promise of simplicity. “Allowing limited deductions like HRA and medical insurance can significantly improve the appeal of the new tax regime while keeping it simple,” says Shweta Rajani, Mutual Fund Head at Anand Rathi Wealth.\n\nRising healthcare costs make this issue harder to ignore. Medical insurance, in particular, remains a major out-of-pocket expense for households. “Medical expenses have been rising steadily, and the absence of mediclaim deductions under the new tax regime is a clear gap,” says Nitin Baijal, Executive Director, Deloitte India, pointing to an area where fine-tuning could broaden adoption.\n\nIncrease the Standard Deduction to Offset Lost Benefits\n\nWith most deductions removed, the standard deduction has become the primary source of relief under the new tax regime. Experts believe there is scope to increase it to better reflect inflation and higher living costs.\n\nBaijal notes, “Raising the standard deduction would provide wide-based relief without increasing compliance complexity. This approach could compensate salaried taxpayers who have given up multiple exemptions.”\n\nOther experts also echo this view, and see this as a critical reform. Vijay Maheshwari, founder of Stocktick Capital says, “Raising the standard deduction to Rs 1-1.25 lakh would help offset inflation and improve take-home income for salaried taxpayers under the new regime.” Adding that such a move would make the system more equitable without reintroducing complexity.\n\nExtend Loan-Linked Benefits Through Formal Channels\n\nEducationloansand home loans continue to be important financial commitments, yet their tax benefits are currently restricted to the old regime. Experts argue that these deductions are relatively easy to administer as they are linked to banks and formal financial institutions.\n\n“Most of this information is already available through bank statements and employer systems, so compliance would not become an issue,” Baijal says. Including such benefits could improve the practicality of the new regime while preserving its simplified structure.\n\nAddress Structural Gaps for Senior Citizens\n\nDespite growing adoption, the new tax regime remains less attractive for senior citizens. Unlike the old regime, it offers no higher basic exemption limits and does not allow health insurance deductions, even as medical expenses rise sharply with age.\n\n“There is a strong case for additional relief for senior citizens under the new regime,” Baijal says, suggesting that slab thresholds could be revisited to provide meaningful relief.\n\nRajani adds, “for retirees, medical and insurance-related expenses make deductions especially relevant, which is why the old regime continues to hold appeal for this segment.”\n\nMove from Ease of Filing to Ease of Financial Planning\n\nFor the new tax regime to become the default by choice rather than compulsion, experts say it must support long-term financial planning.\n\n“Targeted, capped incentives for retirement savings, health insurance and first-home purchases can strike the right balance between simplicity and financial security,” says Maheshwari. He argues that such measures would encourage responsible behaviour without complicating compliance.\n\nOn capital markets, Maheshwari adds “stability matters more than tax cuts. Maintaining current equity LTCG rates, raising the exemption threshold to Rs 2-3 lakh, and offering a clear long-term roadmap to improve investor confidence.”\n\nImprove Tax Certainty Beyond Rates and Deductions\n\nSome experts believe Budget 2026 should focus beyond tax rates altogether. With major reforms like GST and the new tax code already in place, attention could shift to predictability and dispute resolution.\n\n“India does not need lower taxes at this stage; it needs a more efficient and predictable tax regime,” says Sanjiv Malhotra, Senior Advisor - Head of Tax Practice, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. He highlights tax certainty for foreign investors and customs reforms as priority areas.\n\nMalhotra argues that revamping dispute resolution mechanisms, expanding successful models like Advance Pricing Agreements, and extending faceless processes to customs could significantly improve confidence in India’s tax framework.", "company": "", "date": "January 16, 2026/ 18:35 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Priyadarshini Maji"}

{"title": "BMC’s capex-heavy model sets Mumbai apart, but revenue strain looms for next civic leadership", "content": "Mumbai’s civic body, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), stands out among India’s major urban local bodies for both the scale of its spending and its priorities, with capital expenditure now accounting for close to 60 percent of the corporation’s total outlay, one of the highest such ratios in the country.\n\nOver the past decade, BMC’s expenditure has expanded sharply. Total spending has risen from just over Rs 20,000 crore in 2017–18 to an estimated Rs 74,367 crore in 2025–26. What distinguishes this expansion is not just its size, but its composition. While revenue expenditure has grown steadily, capital spending has surged at a much faster pace, jumping from around Rs 5,000 crore in 2017–18 to more than Rs 43,000 crore in 2025–26.\n\nLarge investments in roads, coastal infrastructure, flood mitigation works, transport projects and health facilities have driven this transformation, reshaping Mumbai’s civic balance sheet.\n\nThis aggressive investment-led approach, however, is increasingly raising questions about sustainability—an issue that is likely to confront the new civic leadership that takes charge after January 16. Mumbai goes to the polls on January 15 to elect its councillors after a gap of nearly a decade, and the fiscal choices of the next administration will be closely watched.\n\nThe concern stems from the growing mismatch between spending and revenue growth. While expenditure has surged, BMC’s revenues have risen far more slowly, increasing from about Rs 22,400 crore in 2018–19 to roughly Rs 43,160 crore in 2025–26. This divergence has gradually tightened the corporation’s fiscal headroom, even as infrastructure ambitions have expanded.\n\nThe pressure is especially visible in BMC’s own tax streams. Property tax, typically the most stable source of revenue for urban local bodies, has remained volatile in Mumbai and has yet to show a strong, sustained uptrend. In FY26, property tax is expected to contribute only about 12 percent of BMC’s total revenue, sharply lower than peers such as Bengaluru, where the share is closer to 40 percent. Instead, Mumbai relies heavily on state transfers, which account for more than a third of its income.\n\nOctroi compensation, which became a critical revenue line after the introduction of GST, has provided some support. However, its growth has not been sufficient to fully offset the rapid rise in expenditure commitments, particularly on the capital side.\n\nFor the next city government, the challenge is clear. BMC’s spending quality has improved significantly, and its emphasis on long-term infrastructure sets it apart from most Indian cities. But sustaining such high levels of capital investment will require more predictable and buoyant revenue sources, stronger property tax performance, and sharper monetisation of municipal assets.\n\nWithout a parallel strengthening of the revenue base, even India’s richest civic body could find its ambitious infrastructure push constrained.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 16:02 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Ishaan Gera"}
{"title": "When pledging gold makes more sense than taking a personal loan or using a credit card", "content": "For many households, gold sits quietly in a locker, visited only during weddings or festivals. At the same time, the same families often take personal loans or run up credit card balances to deal with short-term needs. The irony is hard to miss. One of the cheapest borrowing options is already owned, but rarely considered.\n\nGoldloansdon’t get the same attention as personal loans or credit cards because they feel old-fashioned or inconvenient. In reality, they can be far more efficient in the right situations.\n\nWhy gold loans are often cheaper\n\nThe biggest reason gold loans cost less is simple. They are secured. When you pledge gold, the lender holds an asset that is easy to value and easy to sell if things go wrong. That lowers their risk, and lower risk usually means lower interest rates.\n\nPersonal loans and credit cards sit at the other end of the spectrum. They are unsecured. The lender has no collateral, so the interest rate builds in a safety margin. That margin is what borrowers end up paying for, month after month.\n\nOver time, the difference adds up. Even a few percentage points matter when borrowing stretches beyond a few months.\n\nWhen gold loans clearly make more sense\n\nGold loans work best for short- to medium-term needs. A medical expense, a business cash-flow gap, a temporary income disruption, or consolidating high-interest credit card dues are common examples.\n\nIn these cases, the loan isn’t meant to linger for years. It’s meant to be repaid once cash flows normalise. That’s where gold loans shine. Lower interest keeps the cost of borrowing under control while you bridge the gap.\n\nThey also help when credit scores are under pressure. Because the loan is backed by gold, lenders are often less rigid about credit history compared to unsecured loans.\n\nHow gold loans compare to credit cards in real life\n\nCredit cards are convenient, but they are among the most expensive ways to borrow if balances are carried forward. Interest piles up quickly, and minimum payments create the illusion of progress while the balance barely moves.\n\nA gold loan, by contrast, is blunt and predictable. You borrow a fixed amount at a known rate. There’s no temptation to keep spending against it. That clarity often reduces both financial and mental stress.\n\nFor people already stuck in a cycle of rolling credit card balances, shifting part of that debt to a gold loan can be a meaningful reset.\n\nThe risks people underestimate\n\nGold loans are not risk-free. The biggest risk is complacency. Because the loan feels cheaper, borrowers sometimes delay repayment longer than planned. Interest may be lower, but it still accumulates.\n\nThere is also the emotional risk. Gold often carries family or sentimental value. Defaulting on a gold loan doesn’t just mean a financial loss. It can carry personal and family consequences that go beyond money.\n\nLoan-to-value rules and margin calls also matter. If gold prices fall sharply, lenders may ask for additional margin or partial repayment. That risk is rare, but it exists.\n\nWhen gold loans are a bad idea\n\nUsing gold loans for long-term lifestyle spending is usually a mistake. Funding consumption without a clear repayment plan puts the pledged asset at unnecessary risk.\n\nThey also make little sense if income is unstable and repayment visibility is poor. In such cases, the lower interest rate doesn’t compensate for the risk of losing the asset.\n\nGold loans work best as a tactical tool, not as a permanent borrowing habit.\n\nWhat to check before pledging gold\n\nInterest rate is only the starting point. Tenure flexibility, repayment options, storage charges, and how interest is calculated all matter. Some loans require regular interest payments, while others allow interest to roll up until closure.\n\nIt also helps to be realistic about repayment timelines. Pledging gold should come with a clear exit plan, not vague optimism.\n\nGold loans don’t replace personal loans or credit cards. They sit alongside them. Used thoughtfully, they can dramatically reduce borrowing costs. Used casually, they can introduce a different kind of risk.\n\nThe smartest borrowers don’t ask which loan is easiest to take. They ask which loan is easiest to close.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 13:49 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

{"title": "Can IT sector see market re-rating amid positive AI commentary by Infosys after TCS? Analysts say 'evidence of monetisation' needed", "content": "IT stocks saw significant surge on December 16, buoyed by the positive October-December quarter results and management commentary on artificial intelligence (AI) progress by heavyweightInfosys. Analysts have commented on whether the sharp rebound in IT stocks can lead to a market re-rating and take them to fresh highs.\n\nInfosys shares closed around 6 percent higher, leading gains on theNifty IT indexwhich rose more than 3 percent to a three-week high of 39,086.65. Notably, the IT index was the worst performing sector in 2025, falling around 15 percent during the year overall.\n\nInfosys reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 6,654 crore for Q3 FY26, marking a 2.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall from the Rs 6,806 crore net profit reported in Q3 FY25. This however included Rs 1,289-crore one-time cost on account of new labour codes.\n\nThe IT major’s revenue from operations meanwhile rose 9 percent YoY to Rs 45,479 crore. The company revised its fiscal ending 2026 revenue growth forecast upwards to 3-3.5 percent, from an earlier estimate of 2-3 percent.\n\nInfosys said it now has over 500 AI agents and is doingAI workwith more than 90 percent of its top 200 clients, as it pitches itself as an \"AI partner of choice\" for large enterprises. \"They are using agents in several of our service lines to help enhance either growth or productivity,\" CEO and managing director Salil Parekh said during the company's post-earnings press conference on January 14.\n\nInfosys is well placed to benefit from enterprise-wide AI spending, given its discretionary heavy mix, said Motilal Oswal Financial Services, which retained its 'Buy' call on the stock. At the current valuations, upside risks meaningfully outweigh downside risks, it added, while keeping a target price of Rs 2,200 per share for the stock, which implies a 37 percent upside potential from the previous closing price.\n\nInfosys's push for vendor consolidation is boosting growth prospects, while its AI library is strengthening its position as clients expand account sizes during renewals, Morningstar said.\"Infosys is in a better competitive position compared with other Indian IT consulting firms due to its comprehensive AI offerings,\" the brokerage added.\n\nInfosys, which won AI-led deals with Adobe and Siemens AG in 2025, did not disclose revenue from AI projects. Last month, Accenture beat first-quarter revenue estimates on strong demand for AI-driven IT services.\n\nTata Consultancy Services'annualised AI revenuejumped 17.3 percent sequentially to $1.8 billion, outpacing its December quarter growth of 1.96 percent. \"The growth momentum we witnessed in Q2 FY26 continued in Q3 FY26. We remain steadfast in our ambition to become the world’s largest AI-led technology services company, guided by a comprehensive five-pillar strategy,\" CEO and managing director K Krithivasan said.\n\nHCLTech said its AI revenue came in at $146 million, up from $100 million in the previous quarter. Revenue from the company's banking and technology verticals rose by 8.1 percent and 14.4 percent respectively, while that from life sciences fell 2 percent during the quarter.\n\nEarlier this week, Motilal Oswal said it expects AI-related deal conversion to begin to show up in revenue in H2 FY27. This is also when AI-linked productivity deflation begins to be offset by new AI services work. The firm sees large-cap revenue growth rates starting to improve toward the 6-7 percent range, and AI services moving into the full deployment mode by FY28.\n\nIndustry revenue growth rates materially will likely accelerate to 8-9 percent (as against today's 3–4 percent) as AI modernisation, data workloads, and enterprise integration scale up, the domestic brokerage said, adding that this supports a sector-wide rerating as growth visibility improves.\n\nHDFC Securities meanwhile said that AI will remain a dominant factor shaping economic and market conditions going forward, and AI-led recovery will likely accelerate in H2 2026 after a muted H1 for the Indian IT sector.\n\nAccording to a new research survey by Capgemini Research, after an era of 'AI hype', business leaders are now increasingly realistic and pragmatic about their AI strategies, and have started using it in their decision-making.\n\nCan IT rebound lead to markets re-rating?\n\nIT stocks carry a significant share in benchmark indicesSensexandNifty, and are closely tracked by investors globally. Strong earnings from Infosys could act as a short-term sentiment booster for the broader market as a positive earnings outcome and a better outlook help signal that demand conditions in key overseas markets may be stabilising, which supports overall risk appetite, said Ravi Singh, Chief Research Officer at Master Capital Services.\n\nAs confidence builds, this could lead to short-term momentum not only in IT but also in other industries, the analyst said. However, for this to result in long-term market strength, comparable earnings traction must also be seen in other heavyweight sectors, according to Singh. \"If not, the effects of optimism driven by IT are probably going to be more tactical than systemic,\" he added.\n\n\"Although the long-term growth is reinforced by companies like Infosys and TCS's increased focus on AI, it is unlikely to lead to a broad-based valuation re-rating in a short time. Before allocating higher multiples, markets typically wait for stronger evidence of profit, margin growth and steady earnings contribution from AI-led deals,\" Singh said.\n\n'Markets need to see consistent performance in AI space':\n\nFor a rerating, markets need to see consistent quarter performance in the AI space, including tangible deals and acquisitions, said Shravan Shetty, Managing Director at Primus Partners, who added that the earnings commentary and forward guidance would need to point towards this.\n\nNarendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research - Investment Services at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, however noted that with Infosys results, there has been a visible shift in the sentiments in theIT spaceand markets are expecting similar momentum from other companies.\n\n\"IT sector has decent weights in frontline indices and definitely may lead the indices in near term. However, scaling towards fresh highs alone on back if IT sector is possible but difficult at this juncture and need participation from other heavy weights as well,\" he added.\n\nWill strong results trigger re-rating for IT stocks?\n\nSpeaking on whether the strong results will drive a re-rating for IT stocks, Harshal Dasani, Business Head at INVasset PMS, said that AI commentary is directionally constructive, but a full rerating needs evidence of monetisation, not just intent.\n\n\"In the near term, AI is more likely to drive a ‘selective rerating’ within IT rather than a blanket multiple expansion. Companies with higher exposure to short-cycle, ROI-led AI work and strong platform partnerships may see faster earnings revisions, while others may remain range-bound. The rerating trigger for the sector will be consistent: rising AI contribution to deal wins, expanding wallet share in core verticals like BFSI, and confirmation that GenAI is incremental rather than cannibalising legacy work. So yes, AI can change the slope of the cycle—but it is still early, and the market will demand proof through numbers over the next 2–3 quarters,\" Dasani said.\n\nAxis Securities remained 'cautiously optimistic' for the Indian IT sector. It noted that Infosys’ sequential growth trajectory suggests a stable environment rather than an improving one.", "company": "", "date": "January 16, 2026/ 18:13 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Debaroti Adhikary"}

{"title": "SIPs and STPs explained: Two simple tools that can quietly strengthen your mutual fund portfolio", "content": "For most investors, the hardest part of investing is not choosing a mutual fund. It is deciding when to put money in — and when to move it around. Markets rarely move in straight lines, and emotions usually do more damage to portfolios than bad fund choices.\n\nThis is where two simple tools offered by mutual funds — SIPs and STPs — quietly do a lot of heavy lifting.\n\nA Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) helps you build wealth gradually. A Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) helps you deploy or rebalance money more intelligently. Used well, they can make your portfolio more resilient, more disciplined and, over time, more rewarding.\n\nSIP: The habit that does most of the work\n\nA SIP is the easiest way to start. You invest a fixed amount every month (or quarter) into a mutual fund. Sometimes markets are high, sometimes they are low. You buy more units when prices fall and fewer when prices rise. Over long periods, this averages out your purchase cost.\n\nBut the real value of a SIP is not mathematical. It is behavioural.\n\nMost people know they should invest regularly. Very few actually do it unless the process is automated. SIPs turn investing into a habit, like an EMI or a monthly bill. Money goes out before you get the chance to overthink it.\n\nThis matters because missing just a few good months in the market can significantly dent long-term returns. SIPs keep you invested through good times and bad, without asking you to make repeated decisions.\n\nThey also make goal-based investing simpler. Whether it is a child’s education, a house, or retirement, SIPs allow you to link a monthly investment to a long-term goal and stay on track without trying to time the market.\n\nWhy SIPs alone are not always enough\n\nWhile SIPs are excellent for building wealth steadily, they do not solve every problem.\n\nWhat if you receive a large lump sum — a bonus, an inheritance, or proceeds from selling a property? Putting it all into equity at one go can feel risky, especially if markets are already high.\n\nWhat if your asset allocation has drifted? After a long bull market, your equity portion may have grown much larger than you are comfortable with. Or after a long dull phase, you may be sitting on too much debt.\n\nThis is where STPs come in.\n\nSTP: The smarter way to move money\n\nAn STP, or Systematic Transfer Plan, allows you to move money gradually from one mutual fund to another, usually from a debt fund to an equity fund.\n\nThink of it as a SIP, but using your own parked money instead of fresh cash from your bank account.\n\nA common use case is when you have a lump sum. Instead of investing it into equity all at once, you can park it in a liquid or short-term debt fund and set up an STP into an equity fund over, say, 6 to 12 months. This reduces the risk of entering the market at the wrong time, while still ensuring that the money gets invested.\n\nSTPs are also useful for rebalancing. Suppose you want to gradually reduce your equity exposure as you approach a goal. You can set up an STP from equity to a debt fund to shift money in a controlled, disciplined way rather than making one big switch on a nervous day.\n\nSIP and STP together: A simple but powerful combination\n\nUsed together, SIPs and STPs can make your portfolio far more robust.\n\nYour regular monthly investments can continue through SIPs, building long-term positions steadily. At the same time, any large inflows or asset allocation adjustments can be handled through STPs, reducing timing risk and emotional decision-making.\n\nThis combination also helps avoid a common mistake: letting large amounts of cash sit idle for months because you are waiting for the “right time” to invest. With an STP, you accept that you cannot predict the perfect moment, and you let time and process do the work instead.\n\nThe tax and cost angle\n\nIt is worth remembering that STPs are not tax-free switches. Each transfer from one fund to another is treated as a redemption from the source fund and a fresh investment into the target fund. This means capital gains tax can apply, especially if you are transferring from a debt fund held for a short period.\n\nStill, for most investors, the risk management and discipline benefits often outweigh the small tax or exit load costs involved.\n\nSIPs, on the other hand, do not have any special tax treatment by themselves. Each instalment is treated as a separate investment for tax purposes. This becomes relevant when you redeem and different units have different holding periods.\n\nThe bigger picture: Process beats prediction\n\nNeither SIPs nor STPs guarantee high returns. What they do guarantee is something far more valuable: a sensible process.\n\nThey remove the pressure to make perfect timing calls. They reduce the role of fear and greed. They bring structure to what is otherwise a very emotional activity.\n\nOver long periods, portfolios built with discipline usually do better than portfolios built on bold but inconsistent decisions.\n\nSIPs help you enter the market steadily. STPs help you move money wisely once it is inside the system. Together, they turn investing from a series of stressful decisions into a calm, repeatable process.\n\nIn a world where markets are unpredictable but behaviour is often the real enemy, that may be their biggest advantage.\n\n1. Is an STP better than investing a lump sum directly into equity funds?\n\nNot always, but it is often safer. If markets are volatile or already expensive, investing a lump sum through an STP helps reduce the risk of bad timing by spreading the investment over several months. If markets are clearly cheap and you have a high risk tolerance, a lump sum investment may work better. For most investors, though, an STP offers a more comfortable and disciplined approach.\n\n2. Can I run a SIP and an STP at the same time?\n\nYes. Many investors do exactly that. Your SIP can continue for regular monthly investing from your bank account, while an STP can be used separately to deploy a lump sum or to rebalance your portfolio gradually from one fund to another.\n\n3. Does an STP attract tax?\n\nYes. Every transfer in an STP is treated as a redemption from the source fund and a fresh investment into the target fund. This means capital gains tax may apply, depending on how long the source fund units were held and whether it is an equity or debt fund. This is why STPs are usually done from liquid or short-term debt funds, where tax impact is typically smaller.\n\n4. Is a SIP only useful in falling or volatile markets?\n\nNo. SIPs work across market cycles. Their biggest benefit is not just cost averaging, but discipline. They ensure you keep investing during both good and bad phases, which is critical for long-term wealth creation.", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 17:31 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

The index closed 0.35 percent higher at 853.\n\nPrestige Estateswere the top gainer on the index, rising nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 1,524.10 apiece. This comes after the company announced that it has recorded pre-sales worth Rs 4,183.6 crore during the October-December quarter of the ongoing financial year 2026, marking a 30 percent YoY growth.\n\nFor the April-December period, the company’s pre-sales surged 122 percent YoY to Rs 22,327.3 crore, marking the highest sales ever achieved by the company and surpassing its previous full-year peak sales.\n\nThe firm also announced the launch of Evergreen at Prestige Raintree Park in Whitefield, Bengaluru.\n\nMacrotech Developers(Lodha), Oberoi Realty and Godrej Properties shares followed, rising around 1 percent each.Godrej Propertieson January 15 announced that it has emerged as the largest listed residential real estate developer in India in 2025 for the second consecutive year, based on key operating metrics of booking value and cash collections.\n\nThe firm sold 16,428 homes with a total saleable area of 27.26 million sq. ft. in 2025, supported by 41 successful project launches across India.

{"title": "Trade setup for January 19: Top 15 things to know before the opening bell", "content": "The Nifty 50 closed moderately higher amid volatile and rangebound trading on January 16. It attempted twice during the week, including on Friday, to sustain above the 50-day EMA (near 25,900) but failed. Hence, this level can be considered a strong hurdle for a sharp upward journey toward and beyond 26,000. On the other side, the index has been taking healthy support at the 100-day EMA (a tad above 25,600) on a closing basis for the last five straight sessions. Below this, the crucial support is placed at 25,450. Further, the momentum and technical indicators remained largely sideways to bearish. Hence, until the index decisively breaks the 25,600â€“25,900 range on either side, consolidation and caution may continue, experts said.\n\nHere are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades:\n\n1)Key Levels For TheNifty 50(25,694)\n\nResistance based on pivot points: 25,824, 25,874, and 25,954\n\nSupport based on pivot points: 25,663, 25,613, and 25,532\n\nSpecial Formation: The Nifty 50 formed a Doji-like candlestick pattern on both the daily and weekly charts, indicating indecision among market participants. The index traded below short-term moving averages, which trended downward, while the 50-day and 100-day EMAs remained flat for the last five sessions. It also sustained below the rising trendline, which is now acting as resistance after previously being a support trendline. The RSI remained in a narrow range around 40 for more than a week, while the MACD stayed below the signal line. The histogram remained below the zero line, though weakness faded slightly. All this indicates continued consolidation with a cautious to bearish undertone.\n\n2)Key Levels For TheBank Nifty(60,095)\n\nResistance based on pivot points: 60,224, 60,395, and 60,672\n\nSupport based on pivot points: 59,670, 59,499, and 59,222\n\nResistance based on Fibonacci retracement: 60,437, 60,860\n\nSupport based on Fibonacci retracement: 59,392, 59,163\n\nSpecial Formation:The Bank Nifty outperformed the benchmark Nifty 50 with above-average volumes and rallied 0.86 percent after convincingly breaking out of the consolidation of the previous four sessions. The index is now comfortably trading above all key moving averages and has moved closer to the upper Bollinger Bands, forming a long green candle on the daily timeframe. The RSI at 61.43 showed a positive crossover, and the Stochastic RSI maintained a bullish crossover, while the MACD is on the verge of a positive breakout with an almost flat histogram. All this indicates strengthening bullish momentum in the Bank Nifty.\n\n3)Nifty Call Options Data\n\nAccording to the weekly options data, the 26,000 strike holds the maximum Call open interest (with 1.45 crore contracts). This level can act as a key resistance level for the Nifty in the short term. It was followed by the 25,800 strike (1.25 crore contracts) and 25,900 strike (1.1 crore contracts).\n\nMaximum Call writing was observed at the 25,900 strike, which saw an addition of 56.74 lakh contracts, followed by the 26,100 and 25,800 strikes, which added 52.17 lakh and 38.98 lakh contracts, respectively. The maximum Call unwinding was seen at the 25,650 strike, which shed 13.35 lakh contracts, followed by the 25,600 and 25,550 strikes, which shed 98,410 and 77,740 contracts, respectively.\n\n4)Nifty Put Options Data\n\nOn the Put side, the maximum Put open interest was observed at the 25,500 strike (with 74.35 lakh contracts), which can act as a key support level for the Nifty in the short term. It was followed by the 25,700 strike (68.69 lakh contracts) and the 25,600 strike (62.19 lakh contracts).\n\nThe maximum Put writing was placed at the 25,500 strike, which saw an addition of 26.49 lakh contracts, followed by the 25,700 and 25,800 strikes, which added 24.9 lakh and 20.8 lakh contracts, respectively. The maximum Put unwinding was seen at the 26,000 strike, which shed 1.2 lakh contracts, followed by the 26,100 and 26,400 strikes, which shed 1.06 lakh and 18,980 contracts, respectively.\n\n5)Bank Nifty Call Options Data\n\nAccording to the monthly options data, the 60,000 strike holds the maximum Call open interest, with 15.34 lakh contracts. This can act as a key level for the index in the short term. It was followed by the 59,500 strike (14.84 lakh contracts) and the 61,000 strike (8.43 lakh contracts).\n\nMaximum Call writing was observed at the 60,200 strike (with the addition of 96,930 contracts), followed by the 60,100 strike (85,590 contracts) and 61,500 strike (75,180 contracts). The maximum Call unwinding was seen at the 59,700 strike, which shed 1.08 lakh contracts, followed by the 59,500 and 59,800 strikes which shed 98,910 and 96,450 contracts, respectively.\n\n6)Bank Nifty Put Options Data\n\nOn the Put side, the maximum Put open interest was seen at the 59,500 strike (with 20.29 lakh contracts), which can act as a key support level for the index. This was followed by the 60,000 strike (13.22 lakh contracts) and the 59,000 strike (10.89 lakh contracts).\n\nThe maximum Put writing was placed at the 60,000 strike (which added 5.11 lakh contracts), followed by the 60,100 strike (2.14 lakh contracts) and the 60,200 strike (1.44 lakh contracts). The maximum Put unwinding was seen at the 59,200 strike, which shed 17,550 contracts, followed by the 59,400 and 60,600 strikes, which shed 14,610 and 12,210 contracts, respectively.\n\n7)Funds Flow (Rs crore)\n\nThe Nifty Put-Call ratio (PCR), which indicates the mood of the market, dropped to 0.76 on January 16, compared to 0.81 in the previous session.\n\nThe increasing PCR, or being higher than 0.7 or surpassing 1, means traders are selling more Put options than Call options, which generally indicates the firming up of a bullish sentiment in the market. If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.\n\nIndia VIX, also known as the fear index, remained elevated but moved within a range of 10.5â€“12 levels for the third straight session. It sustained above all key moving averages (except the 200-day EMA), signaling caution for bulls. Experts advised staying alert in case the VIX spikes above the 12 zone, which could put bulls at major risk.\n\n10)Long Build-up (55 Stocks)\n\nA long build-up was seen in 55 stocks. An increase in open interest (OI) and price indicates a build-up of long positions.\n\n11)Long Unwinding (28 Stocks)\n\n28 stocks saw a decline in open interest (OI) along with a fall in price, indicating long unwinding.\n\n12)Short Build-up (90 Stocks)\n\n90 stocks saw an increase in OI along with a fall in price, indicating a build-up of short positions.\n\n13)Short-Covering (40 Stocks)\n\n40 stocks saw short-covering, meaning a decrease in OI, along with a price increase.\n\n14)High Delivery Trades\n\nHere are the stocks that saw a high share of delivery trades. A high share of delivery reflects investing (as opposed to trading) interest in a stock.\n\n15)Stocks Under F&O Ban\n\nSecurities banned under the F&O segment include companies where derivative contracts cross 95 percent of the market-wide position limit.\n\nStocks added to F&O ban: Nil\n\nStocks retained in F&O ban: SAIL, Sammaan Capital\n\nStocks removed from F&O ban: Nil", "company": "", "date": "January 18, 2026/ 22:57 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar"}

{"title": "Infosys Q3 net profit falls 2.2% on-year, misses estimate; revenue guidance raised, deal wins steady", "content": "Infosys Ltd raised its FY26 revenue growth guidance even as its consolidated net profit for the fiscal third quarter fell over 2 percent year-on-year due to a labour code-related charge, missing Street expectations. The IT major pointed to steady constant-currency growth, robust deal wins, and improving momentum in a seasonally weak quarter.\n\nInfosysreported a 2.2 percent year-on-year decline in consolidated net profit for Q3 FY26 to Rs 6,654 crore, missing analyst estimates. Revenue for the quarter rose 8.9 percent on-year to Rs 45,479 crore, the company said in its results statement. The company’s net profit was hit as it incurred Rs 1,289 crore on account of labour codes.\n\nA CNBC TV18 poll of analyst estimates had pegged Infosys' October-December net profit at Rs 7,445 crore and revenue at Rs 45,255 crore.\n\nOperating margins came under pressure during the quarter. Reported operating margin declined to 18.4 percent from 21.3 percent a year ago, reflecting higher costs and the impact of labour code-related provisions. On an adjusted basis, operating margin stood at 21.2 percent during the quarter.\n\nIn constant currency terms, Infosys posted revenue growth of 1.7 percent year-on-year and 0.6 percent sequentially. The company also reported strong large-deal activity, with total contract value (TCV) of $4.8 billion in Q3, of which 57 percent was net new, providing support to medium-term revenue visibility.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Infosys raised its FY26 revenue growth guidance to 3.0-3.5 percent in constant currency terms, while reiterating its operating margin outlook of 20-22 percent for the year.\n\nCommenting on the quarter, CEO and Managing Director Salil Parekh said Infosys delivered a strong performance driven by its enterprise AI-led offerings, adding that clients are increasingly viewing the company as a strategic AI partner with strong delivery capabilities.\n\n“Our performance was broad-based in Q3 with sequential revenue growth, margin expansion on an adjusted basis, stellar large-deal wins and robust free cash flow generation in a seasonally weak quarter,” Chief Financial Officer Jayesh Sanghrajka said, adding that the company remained focused on disciplined capital allocation.\n\nInfosys also reported free cash flow of Rs 8,176 crore for the quarter, with adjusted free cash flow of Rs 8,626 crore, translating into a conversion of over 113 percent of adjusted net profit.\n\nAhead of the results announcement, Infosys shares rose 0.6 percent to close at Rs 1,608.9 on the NSE. The stock has declined more than 17 percent over the past year, underperforming the benchmark Nifty 50, which has gained about 11 percent during the same period.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

{"title": "SILVER RATE IN INDIA", "content": "See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market\n\nDiscover the secret world of unlisted shares — analyse India's top pre-IPO companies and invest before they hit the markets\n\nSilver Prices in India: All you need to know about investment, hallmarking and imports Just like gold, silver is also among the most-purchased and preferred investment options in India. Silver is purchased in different forms including silver coins, bars, jewellery, idols, and utensils, among other items. Before investing in silver, it is important to know the current silver rate and further keep track of the market conditions. Apart from the market condition, one must also know about the factors concerning the purity of the silver, the authenticity of the seller, and the standards for determining weight. If you’re planning to invest in silver, here's what you need to know.\n\nAs per the latest numbers, the silver rate in India stands at Rs 70.9 per gram and Rs 70,900 per kg. The prices are updated every day, at par with industry standards.\n\nLike gold prices, silver prices in India are also affected by a number of factors like demand, global market movement, political factors, and government policies.\n\nDemand:During festive and wedding seasons, the demand for purchasing precious metals like gold and silver rises significantly, thus leaving a major impact on their prices.\n\nGlobal market:While silver is considered to be a safer option for investors due to its less volatility, the global market movement also affects the price of silver in India. A drop in oil prices and the dollar usually causes a rise in silver prices. For example, if Rupee falls against the Dollar and the international prices are stable, silver is expected to become costlier inIndia.\n\nPolitical factors and government policies:Global political factors and a number of government policies also affect silver prices in India as any kind of change leads to a global impact, thus playing a role in silver prices.\n\nThe surge in silver imports comes at time when gold has slipped and petroleum growth slowed, likely driven by global price spikes and China export curbs\n\nSilver rates:On the basis of international market prices, silver rates also change on a regular basis. This is why it is important to keep track of silver prices to buy them at the best rates.\n\nMaking charges:Just like gold, jewellers may levy making charges on silver jewellery or cutlery. Therefore, it is important to ask directly about the applied making charges to the jewellers.\n\nSellers:People need to research the sellers before purchasing silver to ensure that they buy genuine products with verified purity. This will not only provide them with good quality silver but will also help them to get the best resale value of silver.\n\nCertification:While buying silver, it is important to check the certification of the jewellery or the other items.\n\nIs investing in silver a bad or good idea?While the cost of silver is far lesser than gold in India, it is still a safe option for investment. Reselling silver jewellery, cutlery, coins, or bars will help get better returns, based on the current market prices.\n\nHow to Differentiate Between Pure Silver and Sterling Silver?Fine silver is 99.9% pure silver and is soft in comparison to sterling silver. Sterling on the other hand is an alloy that is made mostly of silver and includes a small percentage of copper and zinc to strengthen it. While both of these look almost the same, silver is not very durable due to softness and sterling silver can last a lifetime if properly cared for. On the other hand, sterling silver is more easily tarnished than pure silver, because of the other metals in it.\n\nGlobal market fluctuations and inappropriate or unstable demand and supply ratios can lead to an increase in silver rates, thus impacting silver prices in India.\n\nIn comparison to silver jewellery, silver coins or bars are significantly heavier and more durable. Thus, buying silver coins or bars can assure a better return and resale value.\n\nOne can purchase silver bars from banks, certified jewellers, and online agents in India. Customers need to note that banks usually charge higher rates, in comparison to jewellery shops because of the purity checks and assurance that they provide.\n\nHallmarking is essential for ensuring the purity of the silver that you are purchasing. It is used as a seal of purity.\n\nConsidered a purity indicator, while hallmarking is not yet mandatory for silver, getting it done will help ensure that your purchase meets certain quality standards.\n\nThe best time to buy silver is during festive or wedding seasons, as jewellers often provide exciting offers and discounts on purchases.\n\nVAT and GST are usually charged on both the purchase and sale of silver in India.\n\nWhile there are no such regulations over the limit of owning silver in India, the government does charge certain taxes after a certain purchase limit is crossed.\n\nIndia is among the world’s biggest silver importers. According to a government statement, India imported nearly 245 billion Indian rupees worth of silver in FY 2022.\n\nPeople can opt for a number of ways to invest in silver in India. From purchasing silver jewellery to buying silver coins, and bars, and investing in the Commodity Futures Exchange, there are a lot of options. While silver jewellery is usually purchased for personal use, investments in coins and bars are often by banks and institutions for official purposes. Similarly, professional investors opt for investment in the Commodity Futures Exchange, while keeping an eye on the market.\n\nMoneycontrol makes no guarantee or warranty on the accuracy of the data provided on this site, the prevailing rates are susceptible to change with Market value and provided on an as-is basis.

{"title": "India holds ground in US market as electronics and consumer goods blunt tariff impact", "content": "India has managed to hold its ground and, in several cases, expand its footprint in the United States market, despite the imposition of higher American tariffs. Electronics and a range of consumer goods have helped prevent a broader trade slump.\n\nA Moneycontrol analysis shows that close to 60 percent of products imported by the US from India not only recorded higher trade volumes after the tariffs came into effect in August, but also gained share in total US imports over the past 10 months. The pattern suggests that tariff pressure has played out unevenly across categories, with several Indian exports either insulated from the full impact or benefiting from shifts in global supply chains away from competing countries.\n\nElectronics stand out as the clearest area of resilience and expansion. Laptop exports from India to the US surged dramatically after the tariff action. In the two months following the imposition of duties, US laptop imports from India jumped nearly 5000 percent compared with the same period a year earlier. Over the first ten months of the year, imports were up about 1700 percent, while India’s share in total US laptop imports rose by 0.3 percentage points. The scale and speed of the increase highlight how quickly Indian manufacturers have been able to ramp up shipments in response to changing trade conditions.\n\nSmartphones tell a similar story. Largely shielded from the tariff measures, the category has seen sustained momentum. During September and October, US smartphone imports from India rose 343 percent year-on-year. For the year so far, imports were up 215 percent, pushing India’s share in US smartphone imports to around 36 percent. The gains underline India’s growing role as a manufacturing base for global handset makers supplying the American market.\n\nSome of the traditional labour-intensive exports have also remained surprisingly robust. India’s dominance in carpets made from wool and fine animal hair strengthened further, with its share in US imports rising to about 80 percent from 74 percent a year earlier, even as trade volumes in the immediate post-tariff period grew by 4 percent. Toilet and kitchen linen exports rose 7 percent, with India’s share climbing to 44 percent from 41 percent, indicating that price competitiveness and established supply relationships have helped cushion the tariff shock.\n\nBeyond defending existing markets, India has also pushed into new niches. Soybean oilcake exports stand out as an extreme example. Despite facing additional levies of 50 percent, US imports from India during September and October surged by nearly 49,500 percent compared with the same period last year. This translated into India’s share of US soyabean oilcake imports rising to 8.6 percent, from just 2.3 percent earlier, pointing to opportunistic gains even in tariff-hit categories.\n\nTaken together, the data suggest that while higher US tariffs posed a clear risk to bilateral trade, India has so far been able to offset much of the pressure. Rapid scaling up in electronics, steady performance in labour-intensive goods, and selective entry into new product segments have helped keep exports resilient. The broader takeaway is that India’s export basket to the US appears to be both deepening and diversifying, even as global trade becomes more protectionist.", "company": "", "date": "January 16, 2026/ 17:47 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Ishaan Gera"}
{"title": "Can a foreign-citizen son without PAN or Aadhaar act as legal representative on India’s income tax e-filing portal?", "content": "Wondering if your foreign-citizen son, without an Indian PAN or Aadhaar, can register as a legal representative on the Indian Income Tax e-filing portal for the purpose of filing your final ITR, and also become acceptable for legal heir documentation.\n\nAsk Wallet-Wise initiative offers expert advice on matters related to personal finance and money-related queries. You can email your queries to askwalletwise@nw18.com, and we will try to get a top financial expert to address.\n\nI am a 75-year-old resident of India. My only child and legal heir is my son, who is a foreign citizen residing abroad with his family. He does not possess an Indian PAN or Aadhaar; his identification documents have been issued by a foreign government (such as a passport and driving licence).\n\nMy query is regarding the procedure by which my son would be able to register as a legal representative (LR) on the Indian Income Tax e-filing portal after my demise, so that he may file my final Income Tax Return. The portal appears to require the LR’s PAN and Aadhaar details for registration.Additionally, I would like to know whether my son can submit an indemnity bond or a notarised document to establish that he is the sole legal heir to my estate.\n\nExpert’s advice: After a person’s death, the legal heirs are required to file the deceased’s Income Tax Return (ITR) for the period from 1 April up to the date of death. For this purpose, one of the legal heirs must register as the legal representative of the deceased on the Income Tax e-filing portal.\n\nRegistration as a legal representative is permitted only for individuals who hold a PAN. Accordingly, the person must first register as a user on the Income Tax portal. Any individual, including a foreign citizen, is eligible to apply for a PAN in India.\n\nBased on the current registration process, possession of an Aadhaar card is not mandatory. Therefore, your son may apply for a PAN, register on the e-filing portal, and thereafter register as a legal representative to file the ITR after your demise.\n\nNon-residents are not eligible to apply for an Aadhaar card and are also not required to link Aadhaar with PAN. Holding a PAN does not automatically require filing an ITR. A notarised affidavit would be useful in establishing his credentials while registering as a legal representative.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 14:22 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Balwant Jain"}

{"title": "Trade Spotlight: How should you trade TVS Motor, Union Bank of India, Dredging Corporation, Tech Mahindra, ICICI Bank, and others on January 14?", "content": "The benchmark indices gave up some of the previous day’s gains, with the Nifty 50 declining 0.22 percent on January 13. Market breadth was moderately weak, with about 1,491 shares declining against 1,370 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may see consolidation as long as it trades below the midline of the Bollinger Bands. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:\n\nAmol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities\n\nTVS Motor Company| CMP: Rs 3,755.4\n\nAfter declining from higher levels, TVS Motor rebounded from its retracement zone and witnessed a robust recovery. Additionally, on the intraday charts, the stock has given a breakout from its sloping trendline. The upward move in the stock suggests a new leg of a bullish trend from current levels.\n\nFor the next few trading sessions, Rs 3,620 could be the trend-decider level for bulls. If the stock sustains above this level, a further uptrend towards Rs 4,010 can be expected.\n\nJindal Steel| CMP: Rs 1,010.8\n\nAfter a remarkable up move on the daily chart, Jindal Steel witnessed profit booking at higher levels. Following the recent sell-off, the downward momentum in the stock has stalled. Moreover, the stock has found support near its demand zone.\n\nThis formation suggests a revival of the uptrend from current levels in the near future. For positional traders, Rs 980 would be the decisive level. If the stock trades above this level, the uptrend is likely to continue towards Rs 1,080. However, if it closes below Rs 980, traders may prefer to exit long positions.\n\nUnion Bank of India| CMP: Rs 166.19\n\nFollowing its strong up move and a brief consolidation over the last few sessions, Union Bank of India is gaining further traction for a fresh up move. The chart structure indicates a bullish continuation pattern, which is likely to persist in the near term.\n\nAs long as the stock trades above Rs 161, the bullish bias is likely to continue, with an upside target of Rs 178.\n\nAshish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO at Waves Strategy Advisors\n\nDredging Corporation of India| CMP: Rs 1,105\n\nOn the daily chart, Dredging Corporation of India has been trading in a broad consolidation range of Rs 892–1,071 over the past few weeks, indicating an accumulation phase. In the previous session, the stock finally gave a range breakout and managed to close above the range at Rs 1,105. This move was supported by a strong rise in volumes, adding credibility to the breakout.\n\nAdditionally, the MACD has witnessed a bullish crossover for the first time since December 2025, which is a positive sign. For now, any dips towards Rs 1,070–1,075 can be considered a buying opportunity for an upside move towards Rs 1,150. On the downside, the Rs 1,020 level is expected to act as a crucial support.\n\nTech Mahindra| CMP: 1,614.8\n\nOn the daily chart, Tech Mahindra has been moving within a larger triangle pattern since the beginning of December 2024 and is now trading close to the trendline resistance. At the start of this week, the stock found support at the 50-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and witnessed a sharp rebound, forming higher highs and higher lows, which signals an improving price structure.\n\nFor now, a break above Rs 1,635 can confirm a breakout from the triangle pattern, potentially resulting in a fresh rally towards Rs 1,750–1,800, as long as the EMA support near Rs 1,558 remains protected on the downside.\n\nTarget: Rs 1,750, Rs 1,800\n\nICICI Bank| CMP: Rs 1,437\n\nAt the start of the month, ICICI Bank confirmed a breakout from a double-bottom pattern and has successfully retested the breakout zone. The stock is now trading near its prior swing high of Rs 1,442, indicating sustained strength. Over the past two sessions, prices have consistently protected the previous day’s low on a closing basis, which is a positive sign.\n\nAdditionally, the Know Sure Thing (KST) indicator has already given a bullish crossover and is now trading above the zero line, suggesting that positive momentum is likely to continue. A decisive break above the Rs 1,442 level is required for bullish momentum to extend, which could push prices higher towards Rs 1,540, while Rs 1,390 is expected to act as the nearest support.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 03:28 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar"}
{"title": "BMC budget swells, but health, education and drainage lose ground under capex push", "content": "The BJP-led alliance at the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is set to take charge of a civic budget that has expanded rapidly in size, but where the relative importance of key social and urban services has steadily diminished, a Moneycontrol analysis shows.\n\nAs of 17:30, the BJP-led alliance was leading in 120 of the 227 BMC seats, with the BJP itself ahead in 93.\n\nThe political transition comes against the backdrop of a striking fiscal transformation at India’s richest civic body. BMC’s total expenditure has more than doubled in just four years, rising from Rs 35,962 crore in FY22 to Rs 74,367 crore in FY26. Much of this expansion has been driven by an aggressive push on capital expenditure, which now accounts for close to 60 percent of total spendin, among the highest ratios for any urban local body in the country.\n\nA similar pattern is visible in storm water drainage, a critical function for a city repeatedly hit by monsoon flooding. Spending on drains rose from Rs 2,050 crore in FY22 to Rs 3,039 crore in FY26. Yet its share in total expenditure slipped from 5.7 percent to a little over 4 percent, suggesting that flood-mitigation spending has not kept pace with the overall scale-up in civic outlays.\n\nPrimary education has also seen a steady decline in budgetary weight. Allocations increased from Rs 2,966 crore in FY22 to Rs 3,956 crore in FY26, but the sector’s share in total spending dropped sharply—from 8.25 percent to 5.32 percent over the same period. The trend points to a gradual deprioritisation of municipal schooling, even as issues of enrolment, quality and infrastructure remain unresolved.\n\nNot all service heads show the same dilution. Spending on solid waste management, slum development and sanitation has been relatively more stable. Outlays in this broad category nearly doubled from Rs 3,247 crore in FY22 to Rs 6,065 crore in FY26, with its share largely hovering around 8–9 percent through most of the period, dipping in FY25 before a marginal recovery in FY26.\n\nFor the incoming BJP-led alliance, the data underline a central policy challenge. With revenue growth slowing and large capital commitments already locked in, the new dispensation will need to reconcile infrastructure ambitions with the task of arresting the steady dilution of core social and civic services.", "company": "", "date": "January 16, 2026/ 17:53 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Ishaan Gera"}
{"title": "How to swipe smart: Choosing the right credit card without slipping into debt", "content": "Credit cards have a bad reputation, and not entirely without reason. Many people associate them with debt, late fees and stress. But the card itself isn’t the problem. The trouble usually starts with choosing the wrong card, or using a decent card the wrong way.\n\nWhen used thoughtfully, a credit card can smooth cash flow, offer protection on purchases and even save money. When used casually, it can quietly turn everyday spending into a long repayment cycle.\n\nWhy the “best” credit card depends on your life, not the offer\n\nMost people choose credit cards based on what’s advertised. Cashback sounds attractive. Travel points feel aspirational. Lifetime free cards look like an obvious win.\n\nWhat’s often missing is a pause to ask how the card will actually be used. A frequent flyer and a person who mainly pays utility bills don’t need the same card. Someone who pays in full every month should prioritise rewards and benefits. Someone who occasionally carries a balance should care far more about interest rates and fees.\n\nA card that looks generous on paper can be completely mismatched to your spending habits.\n\nThe trap of rewards without discipline\n\nRewards are where many people get pulled in. Cashback, points, vouchers and lounge access all feel like gains. But rewards only work if you never pay interest.\n\nThe moment you roll over a balance, the math flips. Interest charges can wipe out months of rewards very quickly. This is how people end up feeling confused about why a “reward card” seems to be costing them money.\n\nThe safest way to think about rewards is this: they are a bonus for behaviour you were already going to follow, not a reason to spend more.\n\nCredit limits are not spending targets\n\nOne of the most common mistakes is treating the credit limit as permission. If the card allows a certain spend, it feels acceptable to use it.\n\nIn reality, the limit is just the maximum risk the bank is willing to take, not a suggestion for you. Regularly spending close to the limit increases stress, reduces flexibility and can hurt your credit profile over time.\n\nUsing a small portion of the available limit and clearing it consistently keeps the card working for you, not against you.\n\nEMIs and “easy payments” deserve extra caution\n\nCredit cards make EMIs feel painless. Convert a purchase, spread it out, move on. The problem is that multiple small EMIs can pile up without being noticed.\n\nWhat starts as convenience can turn into a fixed monthly burden that eats into future income. Before converting anything into an EMI, it helps to ask whether the purchase would still feel comfortable if income dipped or expenses rose suddenly.\n\nEMIs reduce flexibility. That cost is often invisible upfront.\n\nWhy having fewer cards is usually better\n\nOwning multiple credit cards isn’t automatically bad, but it increases complexity. Different due dates, different terms, different benefits. It becomes easier to miss payments or lose track of spending.\n\nFor most people, one or two well-chosen cards are enough. Fewer cards make it easier to stay organised and disciplined, which matters far more than maximising every possible perk.\n\nHow debt quietly creeps in\n\nCredit card debt rarely arrives all at once. It builds through small rollovers. One month you don’t pay the full amount. The next month interest shows up. Then spending continues as usual, and suddenly the balance feels sticky.\n\nThe key habit that prevents this is simple but strict. Always know whether you’re paying the full amount or not. The moment that changes, the card has shifted from a convenience tool to a debt instrument.\n\nWhat swiping smart actually looks like\n\nSwiping smart doesn’t mean never using a credit card. It means using it with clear rules.\n\nSpend only what you already have the cash to pay for. Pay the full bill every month. Choose benefits that match your real life. And treat any sign of rollover as a warning, not a temporary glitch.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 15:01 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}
{"title": "A decade of Startup India: Data shows how policy rebuilt India’s startup ecosystem", "content": "Startup India has completed ten years with government data showing a structural reset of India’s startup ecosystem, marked by a sharp rise in recognised startups, job creation, capital inflows and faster exits, as policy reforms dismantled long-standing barriers around funding, regulation and market access.\n\nLaunched in 2016, the initiative has moved India from a fragmented, high-risk entrepreneurial environment to a pipeline-driven startup system backed by institutional capital, simplified compliance and access to public markets.\n\nFrom idea-stage failure to institutional seed funding\n\nBefore 2016, early-stage innovation in India routinely failed to secure formal backing, with the lack of seed capital cited as the primary constraint by young firms. Angel funding was limited, geographically concentrated and largely dependent on personal networks.\n\nThis gap was addressed through the Startup India Seed Fund Scheme, launched in 2021 with a Rs 945 crore corpus. As of 2025, 219 incubators across India have been approved to deploy seed capital for proof of concept, prototyping and market entry.\n\nOver the same period, formal recognition expanded sharply. The number of startups recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade rose from around 500 in 2016 to over 2.09 lakh by 2025, shifting innovation from anecdotal success to an institutional pipeline.\n\nScale finance redesigned through public anchoring\n\nScaling beyond the early stage remained a systemic weakness prior to 2016, with venture capital flows prone to sharp pullbacks and limited domestic risk capital.\n\nThis was addressed through the Fund of Funds for Startups, a Rs 10,000 crore programme managed by Small Industries Development Bank of India. Government commitments of over Rs 11,800 crore have been channelled through more than 150 SEBI-registered AIFs, which have collectively invested over Rs 22,900 crore in more than 1,270 startups.\n\nDebt access was expanded through the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups, launched in 2022, enabling collateral-freeloansof up to Rs 20 crore. More than Rs 750 crore in loans have been guaranteed within three years.\n\nOver the past decade, Indian startups and emerging enterprises have attracted over $150 billion in private investment across venture capital, private equity and growth funding.\n\nCompliance reforms reduce regulatory risk\n\nRegulatory uncertainty was a major deterrent before Startup India, with startups subject to the same inspection and compliance regimes as large firms.\n\nSince 2016, more than 47,000 compliances have been reduced, over 4,458 legal provisions decriminalised and more than 64 regulatory reforms introduced. DPIIT-recognised startups are allowed to self-certify compliance with nine labour laws and three environmental laws, avoiding inspections for up to five years.\n\nFast-track exit mechanisms under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code now allow eligible startups to close operations within 90 days, compared with years under the earlier framework.\n\nPublic procurement opens as a market\n\nLack of credible domestic buyers had previously limited scale. Government procurement rules mandating prior turnover and experience effectively excluded startups.\n\nThese requirements were relaxed for recognised startups, allowing participation based on technical capability. Through the Government e-Marketplace, startups have executed transactions worth over Rs 38,500 crore, with more than 30,000 startups participating by 2025.\n\nThis shift repositioned the state as an early customer rather than just a regulator.\n\nExits and capital recycling gain legitimacy\n\nExit constraints had long penalised failure and discouraged repeat entrepreneurship. Alongside fast-track closures, angel tax provisions were amended to exempt investments from accredited investors, AIFs and non-residents. Eligible startups can also claim 100% income tax exemption for three years within their first ten years.\n\nIndia is now among the world’s most active IPO markets. The number of unicorns has risen from four in 2014 to around 120–125 active unicorns by 2025, with a combined valuation exceeding $350 billion.\n\nNew sectors move into the mainstream\n\nThe policy framework has enabled the emergence of new growth sectors. India now has over 1,000 defence startups, more than 380 space startups, nearly 5,000 agritech startups and close to 900 generative AI startups.\n\nGovernment-backed procurement, sector-specific missions and capital support have allowed these firms to move from pilots to deployment, embedding startups into defence, space, agriculture and digital infrastructure.\n\nWhat the data shows after 10 years\n\nIndia is now the world’s third-largest startup ecosystem, growing at 12–15% annually. Startups have generated over 21 lakh jobs, with more than 44,000 new startups added in 2025 alone. Startup shutdowns fell to a five-year low in 2025, indicating a shift from experimentation to sustainability.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 13:27 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol News"}
{"title": "OPINION | Budget 2026 and the expectations of emerging sectors", "content": "With technological advancements reshaping the world, the Union Budget 2025 witnessed enhanced allocations for innovation, research, and development initiatives, recognising them as primary drivers of India’s future economic growth. The Budget also announced the formulation of a national framework for Global Capability Centres (GCCs) to promote their expansion into Tier-2 cities.\n\nFurther, the Government announced the Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) scheme of Rs 1 trillion in November 2025. The scheme aims to inspire innovation, promote private sector collaboration, and shape India’s science and technology roadmap towardsViksit Bharatby 2047. As Budget 2026 approaches, the familiar mix of anxiety and anticipation has reached its annual peak. While every sector has its own expectations, this article focuses on the demands of new-age, technology-driven, emerging and sunrise sectors.\n\nFunding Innovation in New-Age Sectors\n\nTechnological progress and automation are advancing at a tremendous pace across new-age sectors. Frequent disruptions render technologies obsolete quickly, while rapid developments in deep tech, robotics, artificial intelligence, and large language models (LLMs) necessitate continuous and long-term capital investment in research and development.\n\nAlthough the RDI scheme seeks to support this ecosystem, a favourable tax regime for such ventures is the need of the hour. Many technology companies would also be willing to fund such ventures, leading to an exponential investment culture. Given the longer gestation period of research-intensive projects, deferred taxation would be advisable to ensure that the proverbial “golden goose” is not penalised prematurely.\n\nIntroducing accelerated depreciation for investments in high-technology machinery, along with enhanced additional deductions for hiring new employees, could provide a significant boost to enterprises operating in uncertain and uncharted territories. Relaxation of eligibility criteria would further widen the utilisation of these benefits, incentivising more taxpayers while simultaneously addressing the persistent issue of unemployment.\n\nIncentivising Capital and Intellectual Property\n\nGiven the inherently capital-intensive nature of these sectors, lenders should also be incentivised to provide funding. Allowing concessional tax rates on interest income and enabling easier write-offs in cases of default would encourage credit flow. Similar incentives may be extended to large, diversified conglomerates, enabling their substantial capital reserves to be deployed effectively within the innovation ecosystem.\n\nIndia’s patent box regime currently provides a concessional 10% tax rate on royalty income from patents registered in India, subject to at least 75% of related expenditure being incurred domestically. While this aligns taxation with substantive economic activity, the requirement that patents be initially registered by individuals and subsequently transferred to companies makes the regime cumbersome, risky, and unpopular.\n\nSimplifying the patent box framework and extending it to cover other forms of intellectual property would significantly enhance its attractiveness and utilisation.\n\nStrengthening the GCC Ecosystem\n\nSeveral states have introduced GCC policies, though these largely focus on non-tax incentives such as access to capital, training, and upskilling programmes. Reintroducing tax holidays for GCCs at the national level would provide a much-needed impetus to the knowledge sector.\n\nGCCs typically provide services to overseas group entities and are therefore subject to Indian transfer pricing regulations. However, safe harbour provisions currently apply only to companies with revenues of up to INR 3 billion. This threshold effectively excludes growing enterprises and penalises successful expansion. Removing the revenue cap altogether would enable more companies to benefit from safe harbour certainty. Additionally, expanding the scope of eligible activities would allow more industries to avail themselves of acceptable safe harbour rates.\n\nThe new Indian Income-tax Act, 2025 is expected to come into force from 1 April 2026. The legislation aims to simplify tax laws, enhance certainty, and align India’s tax system with global best practices. While Budget 2026 may not introduce sweeping changes for all taxpayers, the expectations of sectors with the greatest potential to drive growth and employment cannot be overlooked.\n\nThe demands of new-age technology companies, GCCs, and other innovation-led enterprises capable of generating large-scale employment should be addressed favourably by Ms Sitharaman. Doing so would ensure that Budget 2026 delivers the long-awaited impetus for economic progress—without inhibitions—despite prevailing global tariff challenges.\n\n(SR Patnaik, Partner (Head-Taxation) and Reema Arya, Consultant-Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.)\n\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stance of this publication.", "company": "", "date": "January 16, 2026/ 11:58 IST", "category": "opinion", "author": "SR Patnaik&\n                                                                                                               Reema Arya"}

{"title": "OPINION | Industry seeks tax, GST and duty reforms across oil and gas", "content": "The active management of production and supplies by OPEC+ has supported crude oil prices, which are currently at levels of approximately USD 60–61 per barrel at the beginning of January 2026. At higher crude oil prices, the ad valorem cess of 20% limits the realisations and cash accruals of upstream companies compared to the earlier fixed cess per metric tonne. Therefore, a downward revision in the cess on crude oil production from the current level may help upstream companies improve their earnings in a higher crude oil price regime.\n\nIn addition to cess, the National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) of ₹50 per metric tonne on crude oil imports was introduced in 2003 for a period of one year; however, it has remained in force since then. The industry has been seeking a review of this levy.\n\nGST, Service Tax and Tax Demands\n\nOne of the prominent demands of the upstream industry is the GST exemption for exploration and development activities. Further, the industry seeks removal of service tax on cost petroleum (which can be enumerated), profit petroleum and royalty, as these are not payments against any service and therefore should not be subject to service tax.\n\nEarlier, the Government had incentivised the upstream industry through a seven-year tax holiday under Section 80-IB(9), which was available for undertakings that commenced commercial production up to 1 April 2017. The industry is seeking restoration of these tax holidays for new blocks.\n\nRoyalty Structure and Capital Expenditure Incentives\n\nAt present, royalty on production from nomination blocks is levied at 20% of the wellhead price for onshore areas. The upstream industry has been seeking a tapering of this rate to 12.5%, which is equal to the rate applicable to crude oil produced from blocks under the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP).\n\nIn the past, the Government incentivised the oil and gas industry by allowing a 15% deduction under Section 32AC on capital expenditure incurred on plant and machinery. This benefit was discontinued for new investments made after 1 April 2017. As refineries undertake substantial capital expenditure for capacity augmentation and upgradation, the industry has been requesting restoration of the deduction under Section 32AC.\n\nGST and Excise Issues in Gas, Pipelines and Biofuels\n\nGoods and services procured for the construction of petroleum and natural gas pipelines—such as pipes, gas compressors and works contract services—are not eligible for input tax credit (ITC), while attracting GST of up to 18%. This significantly increases project costs. The industry has requested that GST on such goods and services be exempted or levied at a concessional rate of 5%.\n\nCurrently, Central Excise Duty is applicable on compressed natural gas (CNG), in addition to GST on the process of compression of natural gas into CNG. To avoid double taxation and promote the use of natural gas, the industry seeks exemption of CNG from Central Excise Duty and/or GST.\n\nFurther, when compressed biogas (CBG) is blended with natural gas, it attracts Excise Duty and VAT applicable to CNG but does not enjoy the benefit of ITC on GST paid for procurement of biogas/CBG. This results in a significantly higher tax incidence. The industry has therefore requested full exemption of biogas/CBG, when blended with CNG, from Central Excise Duty.\n\nNatural Gas Transportation, Imports and Refinery Operations\n\nThe GST rate on services relating to transportation of natural gas through pipelines is currently 18% with ITC or 5% without ITC. The industry has proposed that GST at 5% with ITC benefit be made applicable to reduce transportation costs and promote cleaner energy. Additionally, to encourage the use of natural gas as fuel, liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports should be exempted from customs duty, as crude oil attracts nil duty while LNG currently attracts 2.5%.\n\nIntermediate products such as reformate, LGO, VGO and naphtha are exchanged among refineries to ensure optimal utilisation of secondary processing units. These streams are subject to GST at 18%, but as they are used in the manufacture of non-GST goods, ITC is not available to the receiving refinery. The industry has requested removal of GST on such inter-refinery supplies or reduction to a nominal rate of 0.1%.\n\nAdditionally, the industry has been demanding the imposition of anti-dumping duties on several products and petrochemicals, such as bitumen and iso-nonyl alcohol, to curb dumping. In view of the significant increase in base oil imports in recent years, the industry has also sought an increase in customs duty on base oils from the current 5.5% to encourage domestic production.\n\nFinally, the industry continues to advocate for inclusion of natural gas and petroleum products under the GST regime to enable seamless flow of input tax credits and eliminate stranded taxes.\n\n(Prashant Vasisht, SVP and Co-Head Corporate Ratings, ICRA Ltd.)\n\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stance of this publication.", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 10:49 IST", "category": "opinion", "author": "Prashant Vasisht"}

Directly investing in defense companies echoes China’s civil-military fusion, said Kelly Grieco, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center.\n\n“Washington needs to ask itself what role it wants government to play in markets, including defense markets,” Grieco said. “There is a risk of distorting the market an discouraging competition, if the Pentagon becomes both the investor and the buyer.”\n\nL3Harris will remain the majority shareholder, and the Defense Department will not serve on the board of governors or be involved in managing the company or the investment, Chief Executive Officer Chris Kubasik said during a Tuesday media briefing.\n\n“We have no interest in exercising control over the company,” said Michael Duffey, the Pentagon’s undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment, although he added that the Defense Department is done “writing checks” to expand the industrial base “with no promise of return.”\n\nUS defense efforts call for increased numbers of systems such as the SM-6 and SM-3 Block IIA air defense missiles, and advanced strike missiles such as PrSM.\n\nLockheed Martin Corp. said last week it had reached a deal with the Defense Department to more than triple production of Patriot PAC-3 missiles from about 600 a year to 2,000.\n\nAnduril Industries purchased a solid-rocket motor company in 2023 and has invested more than $75 million in building a production facility in McHenry, Mississippi. Last month, Boeing Co. chose Anduril to build the rocket motors for the US Army’s Integrated Fires Protection Capability system.\n\nThe Pentagon sees robust competition in the solid-rocket motor industry but chose to invest directly in L3Harris for the sake of speed, as it is a proven supplier.\n\nEven so, the demand to ramp up munitions production is so high and promises so much expansion “that there will be room for future competition and will result in the growth that we need throughout the industrial base,” Duffey said.\n\nThe L3 Harris announcement comes a day after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth pushed the industry to speed innovation, lamenting what he called defense companies’ “risk-averse culture.”\n\nThe administration has threatened to cut out some major contractors if they don’t accelerate production and innovation, with President Donald Trump demanding they cap executive pay, and stop issuing dividends and buying back their own stock.\n\nHe singled out RTX Corp., whose Raytheon unit makes the Patriot air defense system, calling them “one of the least responsive” companies to the needs of the Defense Department.\n\nBloomberg Economics analyst Becca Wasser said the L3Harris deal aimed to fill a gap in the motors needed for drones and missiles.\n\n“The shortage of rocket motors and the small number of qualified suppliers is a choke point for ramping up munitions production,” Wasser said.", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 22:49 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Bloomberg"}

{"title": "Budget 2026: Can NPS tax incentives alone bridge India’s retirement savings gap?", "content": "With Budget 2026 around the corner, expectations are building around a possible increase in the National Pension System (NPS) tax deductions. A higher limit, from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh, could benefit salaried and self-employed individuals seeking additional tax-efficient retirement avenues, while offering meaningful relief to middle-income earners.\n\nThe move may also help align India’s retirement incentives more closely with global practices. However, questions remain on whether enhanced NPS benefits would divert savings from EPF, PPF, or insurance products, and whether tax tweaks alone can meaningfully bridge India’s widening retirement savings gap. If NPS deductions are increased, who stands to benefit the most?\n\nAccording to Rajarshi Dasgupta, Executive Director (Tax) at Aquilaw, salaried employees shall benefit most from higher NPS deductions due to their current tax profiles. Whereas the self-employed could benefit more in terms of increased retirement participation if policy adjustments target them, too.\n\n“Reduced tax liability can be significant for salaried individuals who otherwise fall into higher tax brackets. The self-employed currently have less automatic retirement coverage, with no EPF benefits, and lower participation in formal pension plans.\n\n“If a higher NPS deduction limit were introduced specifically for them, it could significantly boost retirement savings behaviour, since this group constitutes a large share of India’s workforce and is presently under-covered,” said Dasgupta.\n\nFor government employees, he reasons that they already often have structured pension setups (including NPS or legacy pension options), so incremental tax deductions alone don’t change their tax burden as much. The main value for them is in long-term retirement income rather than tax relief per se.\n\nEmployer contributions to NPS are eligible for tax deduction under Section 80CCD(2), up to 14 percent of basic salary plus DA in the case of government employees, while the limit for private-sector employees is 10 percent.\n\nSeparately, individuals—including private-sector employees and the self-employed—can claim an additional deduction of up to Rs 50,000 under Section 80CCD(1B), over and above the Rs 1.5 lakh cap under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.\n\n“The incremental relief from increasing the NPS cap is proportional to one’s marginal tax rate— higher earners save more per rupee contributed. But for middle-income taxpayers, even a modest increase could shift some of their income into a lower effective tax bracket,” says Dasgupta.\n\nHe argues that if the limit is raised to Rs 1 Lakh or Rs 1.2 Lakh, a middle-income earner (say Rs 8-15 lakh per year) could reduce taxable income by an extra Rs 50,000-70,000 over the current cap, which could translate to Rs 10,000-21,000 in immediate annual tax savings from the incremental deduction alone.\n\nCan a higher NPS limit reduce reliance on EPF, PPF, or insurance?\n\nA higher tax deduction limit would indeed benefit salaried and self-employed individuals seeking additional tax-efficient retirement avenues. However, could this exemption lead to reduced dependence on other employee-linked pension schemes like the Employee Provident Fund (EPF), the Public Provident Fund (PPF), or insurance-linked savings?\n\nRohitaashv Sinha, Partner, King Stubb & Kasiva, Advocates and Attorneys, said, “An enhanced NPS limit would not replace EPF, PPF or insurance-linked products, but would rebalance retirement planning by promoting market-linked, pension-oriented savings over fragmented instruments.”\n\nDasgupta also seconds the thought. “Higher NPS deductions could channel some retirement savings away from other instruments toward NPS, but fundamental differences in risk, liquidity and purpose mean they will continue co-existing in a diversified portfolio.”\n\nHigher NPS vs. retirement gap\n\nTax analysts argue that higher upfront tax incentives can expand pension plan participation rates– particularly among voluntary savers, formal workers, and middle-income earners– but they must be part of a broader policy push to truly broaden retirement preparedness across India.\n\n“Expanding NPS deductions can play a critical role in narrowing India’s retirement savings gap by nudging households toward disciplined, long-term pension accumulation while easing future fiscal pressure on social security systems,” said Sinha.\n\nHowever, tax incentives alone aren’t enough.\n\n“There are also coverage gaps that stem from lack of awareness, irregular incomes, and financial literacy issues, especially in rural or informal segments.\n\nNPS tax perks help those already in the tax net more than those outside it. Without complementary policies– like auto-enrolment, portability improvements, incentives for employers in the private sector– higher limits mainly benefit formal workers,” said Dasgupta.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 11:41 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Dipen Pradhan"}

{"title": "Option writing before the Budget: Why calendars beat naked shorts", "content": "Option writing in January is a trap. Options turn expensive before the budget, and this kills option writers. This time it's especially dangerous. Since August 2025, VIX and IV or Implied Volatility (the barometers of perceived risk and option expensiveness) have been at lower levels. That makes option writing riskier than it looks. So what should you do? How do you navigate this tricky scenario? Let's unpack this step by step.\n\nLet's understand the risk for you as an option writer in detail.\n\nWriting options when India VIX and IV are at lower levels means you're selling cheap options. If perceived risk increases (VIX and IV rise), those same options become expensive. Example: An ATM Nifty option might trade at Rs 200 when options are cheap. The same option can jump to Rs 300 or Rs 350 if perceived risk increases, even if Nifty stays flat. This is a P&L killer for you as an option writer.\n\nWhy does this happen in January? The budget. Participants expect big directional moves from possible policy changes. Perceived risk rises. Options get expensive.\n\nWhat's the solution for you? Calendar spreads.\n\nWhat is a Calendar Spread?\n\nIn a calendar spread, you buy a longer-term expiry option and sell a nearer-term option with the same strike price and same option type. This is called buying a calendar spread. The option you buy will always be costlier than the option you sell. You pay net premium upfront, hence the name Buy Calendar Spread. Example: Buy 26,000 Feb Call, Sell 26,000 Jan Call.\n\nHow does Buy Calendar Spread help?\n\nFirst, you have protection against rising volatility. You bought an option against the one you sold. If perceived risk rises and options become expensive, you're covered. Any rise in premiums affects all options of the same index or stock almost equally. This reduces the impact of rising premiums significantly for your overall position.\n\nSecond, margins are lower compared to naked option writing. You're buying one option against selling another, so the margin requirement drops substantially. But here's the real advantage: the sold option is closer to expiry, so its premium erodes quicker than the bought option. This time-based erosion works in your favor.\n\nThird, you have limited and defined risk. Imagine a slow-moving market suddenly gaps up or down overnight. This would devastate naked option writers with unlimited loss potential. With calendar spreads, the most you can lose is the net premium paid upfront.\n\nKey Points to Remember:\n\nIV describes the perceived risk we've discussed throughout this article. IV for an option is now publicly available information on most trading platforms. You're better off trading in options where nearer-term option IV is higher than longer-term expiry option IV. This spread in IV levels is what makes the strategy profitable.\n\nThis strategy delivers better returns closer to expiry, so it's best suited for weekly expiries rather than monthly ones.\n\nThus, to continue writing options with reduced risk in January before the budget, Calendar Spreads are your better option.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Riders had warned that aggressive time-bound delivery models were pushing them to take risks on the road to meet targets.\n\nThe quick-commerce and food delivery market has expanded rapidly, with companies commanding large valuations. Swiggy is valued at around $11 billion, while rival Zomato has a market capitalisation of nearly $28 billion, underscoring the scale and influence of the sector.\n\nSeveral platforms, including Swiggy's Instamart, Blinkit and Zepto, have built their branding around ultra-fast deliveries, particularly the 10-minute promise. However, delivery workers have argued that such marketing strategies often translate into intense pressure on the ground, affecting both safety and overall well-being.\n\nRegulatory oversight of the gig economy has also gathered momentum at the state level. Rajasthan became the first state in 2023 to enact a law governing gig work, setting up a welfare board, creating a social security fund and establishing mechanisms to address worker grievances.\n\nMore recently, Karnataka-home to India's technology hub Bengaluru-and Jharkhand have passed similar legislation, while Telangana is examining the possibility of introducing its own framework.\n\nDespite the challenges, the gig economy has played a role in expanding workforce participation, particularly among women.

{"title": "Pakistan and India remain similar, yet different in defence purchase profiles", "content": "At first glance, India and Pakistan appear to be travelling similar paths in defence procurement. Over the past two decades, aircraft have dominated arms imports for both countries, reinforcing the centrality of air power in South Asia’s strategic calculus. But beneath that surface similarity lies a widening divergence. The composition of what each country buys—and what it prioritises—reveals two different military trajectories.\n\nFor India, aircraft have historically been the backbone of defence imports, but their dominance has gradually eased. Between 2007 and 2012, aircraft made up roughly 60 percent of India’s arms purchases, rising marginally to 61 percent in the 2013–18 period. Since then, their share has dropped to about 45 percent in 2019–24. This decline does not signal a reduced focus on air power. Instead, reflects a broadening of India’s procurement strategy.\n\nMissiles have emerged as a major pillar of this shift. Their share of India’s defence imports has surged from just over 6 percent in 2007–12 to around 21 percent in the most recent period. Alongside this, spending on air-defence systems and artillery has risen steadily.\n\nEven armoured vehicles, which had seen their share fall in the mid-2010s, have staged a modest recovery.\n\nThis diversification is unfolding even as New Delhi prepares for another major fighter aircraft acquisition. Following Operation Sindoor, aircraft remain central to India’s military planning. According to a January 14 report by ANI, the government may clear a Rs 3.25 lakh crore proposal to acquire 114 Rafale fighter jets from France.\n\nFrance accounted for 31 percent of India’s defence imports during 2019–24, a sharp jump from just 5.1 percent in the previous six-year period and less than 1 percent between 2007 and 2012.\n\nPakistan’s procurement profile, while also aircraft-heavy, tells a markedly different story. Aircraft have consistently formed a smaller share of its arms imports—about 45 percent in 2007–12, falling to 38 percent in 2013–18 and stabilising around 39 percent in 2019–24.\n\nThe more striking change has been at sea. Naval platforms have surged to nearly 29 percent of Pakistan’s defence imports in the latest period, up sharply from just 11 percent in the preceding decade.\n\nMissile imports in Pakistan’s case have been far more volatile. Their share jumped to around 20 percent in 2013–18, before dropping below 9 percent in 2019–24.\n\nSpending on air-defence systems has also fallen sharply in recent years, while artillery has accelerated. While both countries continue to value air power, India’s recent procurement choices point to an effort to integrate aircraft with missiles, sensors, air-defence networks and artillery. Pakistan, by contrast, appears to be concentrating resources on strengthening its navy, even as other segments fluctuate.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 14:57 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Ishaan Gera"}

That helped lift the Nifty IT index meaningfully in today’s session and provided a sentiment tailwind to the broader market.\n\n“The setup is encouraging because IT valuations had become more reasonable after underperformance, and even modest upgrades can trigger short-covering. However, a sustained index breakout needs earnings breadth beyond IT—financials, consumption, and industrial capex must also deliver. So, Infosys can be a catalyst for confidence, but new highs are ultimately a function of aggregate earnings visibility and global liquidity,” he added.\n\nA positive earnings outcome and a better outlook help signal that demand conditions in key overseas markets may be stabilizing, which supports overall risk appetite, said Ravi Singh, Chief Research Officer at Master Capital Services. He added that as confidence builds, this could lead to short-term momentum not only in IT but also in other industries.\n\nFollow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.", "company": "", "date": "January 16, 2026/ 13:49 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Debaroti Adhikary"}

{"title": "When debt consolidation makes life easier, and when it makes things worse", "content": "Debt consolidation loans are often sold as relief. One EMI instead of many. One due date. One lender. On paper, it looks like the kind of decision that should instantly make life easier.\n\nSometimes it does. Sometimes it does the opposite. The difference lies not in the loan itself, but in why you’re taking it and what you do after.\n\nWhy consolidation feels like a solution\n\nMultiple EMIs are exhausting. Credit cards, personalloans,buy-now-pay-later bills, maybe a small consumer durable loan thrown in. Each has its own interest rate, due date and penalty structure. Just keeping track can feel overwhelming.\n\nA consolidation loan promises order. You roll everything into one loan, ideally at a lower interest rate, and replace chaos with a single predictable payment. For people already stretched emotionally, that sense of control is powerful. And in some cases, it’s justified.\n\nWhen consolidation genuinely helps\n\nDebt consolidation works best when the math is clearly in your favour. If you’re replacing high-interest credit card balances or short-tenure personal loans with a lower-interest loan, the savings are real. Fewer penalties, lower interest outgo, and a clearer repayment path can reduce both financial and mental stress.\n\nIt also helps when your income is stable and you’re not adding new debt. In that situation, consolidation simplifies repayment without increasing overall risk. You’re not escaping debt. You’re restructuring it in a way that’s easier to manage.\n\nFor some people, that simplification alone is enough to stop the spiral of missed payments and late fees.\n\nWhere consolidation starts to backfire\n\nProblems begin when consolidation is used as emotional relief rather than a financial reset.\n\nOne common mistake is stretching repayment too far. A lower EMI feels comforting, but a longer tenure can mean paying far more interest over time. The stress disappears monthly, but grows quietly in the background.\n\nAnother issue is behaviour. Clearing multiple loans at once can create a false sense of progress. Credit cards get wiped clean, limits reopen, and spending resumes. Now you have the consolidation loan and fresh card balances. Stress doesn’t reduce. It multiplies.\n\nThis is where consolidation becomes dangerous. It masks the problem instead of fixing it.\n\nThe interest rate trap people miss\n\nNot all consolidation loans are cheap. Many are unsecured personal loans with rates that are lower than credit cards, but still high. When processing fees, insurance add-ons, and longer tenures are factored in, the benefit narrows.\n\nIf the interest rate difference is small, consolidation may not be worth the loss of flexibility. Credit cards, for all their faults, allow partial payments and short-term manoeuvring. A single large EMI does not.\n\nMissing one consolidated EMI can damage your credit score more sharply than juggling smaller obligations.\n\nWhen consolidation increases mental pressure\n\nDebt consolidation can increase stress if it locks you into a payment that leaves no breathing room. A single EMI that eats up too much of your monthly income leaves no buffer for emergencies.\n\nIt also increases pressure when it’s taken too early. If income is uncertain or expenses are still unstable, consolidation freezes your situation before it’s ready to be frozen. Any shock after that feels harder to absorb.\n\nIn these cases, stress doesn’t reduce. It just changes shape.\n\nThe question that matters more than the loan\n\nBefore taking a consolidation loan, it helps to ask one uncomfortable question. Has the reason for the debt stopped?\n\nIf overspending, income gaps, or poor planning are still in play, consolidation is premature. It will buy time, not relief.\n\nIf the situation that created the debt is genuinely behind you, consolidation can be a clean reset. Without that change, it becomes a cosmetic fix.\n\nWhat consolidation is, and isn’t\n\nA debt consolidation loan is a tool. It’s not a solution by itself. Used at the right moment, with discipline and realistic repayment terms, it can simplify life and\n\nreduce anxiety. Used as an escape hatch without behavioural change, it often deepens the problem.\n\nThe real relief doesn’t come from fewer EMIs. It comes from fewer reasons to borrow again.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 18:01 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}
{"title": "India in Davos 2026: Ten states woo investors at the World Economic Forum as a new world order takes shape", "content": "Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings famously said that his biggest competitor is sleep.\n\nIn 2026, the streaming giant has a formidable rival in Trump’s White House.\n\nFrom visuals of a deported, handcuffed Maduro wishing onlookers a Happy New Year, to Greenland’s fate hinging on what gets posted on Truth Social, to Maria Corina Machado gifting her Nobel Peace Prize to make peace with Trump, it’s been a riveting, binge-worthy few weeks already\n\nIt reminds one of a meme often shared on social media, where Captain Haddock says to Tintin, “What a week, huh?”, and Tintin quips, “Captain, it’s Wednesday.”\n\nWhen The New York Times recently asked Trump what limits his global power, he said, “My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me,” adding, “I don’t need international law.”\n\nIt is against this backdrop of chaos and uncertainty that leaders from around the globe will convene at the Swiss ski town of Davos for the 56th World Economic Forum (WEF), under the theme “A Spirit of Dialogue”.\n\nAs it happens, the WEF has had its own share of drama in the last year, with its octogenarian founder, Klaus Schwab, making an ignominious exit after five decades at the helm, under a cloud of alleged financial misappropriation.\n\nCountries are bracing for a new world order-power trumps rules (pun intended), there is a shift from a globally integrated marketplace to a geopolitical one, sovereignty isn’t guaranteed, and China’s technological superpower status is on the ascent.\n\nEconomists and diplomats increasingly describe an environment where markets are no longer neutral, and trade, technology, and capital flows are shaped as much by power politics as by price signals.\n\nIn this context, India’s presence in Switzerland takes on added significance, as the country seeks to position itself as a credible, resilient, and scalable destination for global capital.\n\nIndia’s delegation is one of its largest ever at Davos, with ten state governments joining central leaders and top business executives.\n\nApart from Union Ministers Ashwini Vaishnaw, Pralhad Joshi, and Kinjarappu Ram Mohan Naidu, there will be delegations from Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Kerala. Barring Andhra which has a separate pavilion, others will be on the same floor in the India pavilion\n\nWEF regular Tamil Nadu is skipping Davos this time due to the upcoming state elections.\n\nIndia’s show of strength comes weeks ahead of the Global India AI Summit in New Delhi, which top technology leaders and CEOs are expected to attend. Its mandate at Davos is twofold: to project economic opportunity and shape global policy discussions.\n\nState governments are actively promoting investment-ready projects, while central leaders are expected to engage on issues such as managing geo-economic tensions, securing critical minerals, and adopting AI responsibly.\n\nIndia’s participation is not only about signing deals but also about signalling where it fits in a fractured, geopolitically driven global economy.\n\nEven as negotiations for the much-anticipated Indo-US trade deal are underway, India has been stitching together free trade agreements with Europe and the UK, while also repairing economic ties with China.\n\nWhile India’s headline growth is strong, private consumption-which accounts for about 60% of GDP-lags, and investment remains heavily government-driven. If technological advancements fail to generate enough employment, weak consumption could act as a drag on the economy, even as AI-driven growth in other countries, particularly the US, reshapes global markets.\n\nThe World Economic Forum’s January 2026 Chief Economists’ Outlook highlights that while growth prospects in South and East Asia remain strong, uncertainty is elevated as trade and investment policy is now heavily influenced by geopolitics.\n\nTariffs, export controls, and industrial subsidies have become routine, reshaping global commerce.\n\nPredatory politics are also on the rise, particularly under the influence of a renewed Donald Trump-era US policy. China’s rise as a technological superpower, meanwhile, is creating trade imbalances and fuelling concerns about industrial displacement. Its dominance in advanced manufacturing, EVs, batteries, AI hardware, and clean-tech supply chains underscores the need for countries like India to offer alternative manufacturing and innovation hubs.\n\nOverlaying these dynamics is a scramble for critical resources, including rare earths and energy-transition materials, which are increasingly central to industrial strategy and national security.\n\nAccording to the WEF’s Global Risks Report 2026, geo-economic confrontation is now the top near-term risk, overtaking armed conflict and environmental threats. Around 50% of respondents expect a turbulent global environment over 2026–28.\n\nFor India, risks include cyber insecurity, widening income inequality, public service gaps, and exposure to global economic downturns-emphasising the importance of digital resilience and inclusive growth.\n\nThe 56th edition of WEF in Davos-Klosters, from January 19 to 23, will bring together nearly 3,000 leaders from over 130 countries, including 400 top political leaders and 850 CEOs.\n\nDonald Trump, President of the United States; Mark Carney, Prime Minister of Canada; Emmanuel Macron, President of France; Friedrich Merz, Federal Chancellor of Germany; Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission; He Lifeng, Vice-Premier of the People’s Republic of China; Javier Milei, President of Argentina; Prabowo Subianto, President of Indonesia; and Pedro Sánchez, Prime Minister of Spain, are among the heads of state in attendance.\n\nTop AI leaders such as Jensen Huang, Satya Nadella, Demis Hassabis, and Dario Amodei, among others, will also be present.\n\nMoneycontrol will be on the ground with a raft of insightful interviews and conversations.

{"title": "Your phone is gone. Here’s what to do in the first 30 minutes to protect your money", "content": "When a phone is stolen, the first reaction is rarely calm. There is shock, anger, and the instinct to chase what is already gone. Somewhere in that chaos, an uncomfortable realisation follows: your phone is not just a device. It is your wallet, your identity, and the key to your bank accounts.\n\nWhat you do in the first 30 minutes matters far more than what phone you buy next. The priority is not tracking the handset. It is protecting your money.\n\nHere is how to think about those first critical minutes.\n\nFirst, stop the financial bleeding\n\nThe most immediate risk after a phone theft is unauthorised access to banking and payment apps. Even if your phone was locked, you should assume compromise.\n\nCall your bank immediately and block mobile banking access. Do not wait to “check if anything has happened”. Ask them to disable UPI, mobile app logins, and card tokenisation linked to the device.\n\nNext, block your SIM card through your telecom provider. This step is crucial because many banking and payment systems still rely on SMS-based OTPs. As long as the SIM is active, your accounts remain vulnerable.\n\nIf you use credit or debit cards saved on your phone, call the card issuer and request a temporary block. This is faster than disputing fraudulent transactions later.\n\nThese calls are uncomfortable, but they are the fastest way to put a wall around your money.\n\nLock down digital access, not just the device\n\nOnce the immediate banking risk is contained, move to your email account. This is the control centre for password resets across services.\n\nChange your email password from another device and enable two-factor authentication if it is not already active. If someone has access to your email, they effectively have access to everything else.\n\nThen change passwords for key apps, especially banking, investment platforms, payment wallets, and cloud storage. Do not try to do this for every app. Focus on the ones connected to money and identity.\n\nIf you use Google or Apple services, mark the phone as lost and sign out of it remotely. This helps limit access even if the phone remains powered on.\n\nFile the complaint, even if recovery feels unlikely\n\nFiling a police complaint is not just a formality. It is required for SIM replacement, insurance claims, and in some cases, banking disputes.\n\nProvide the IMEI number if you have it. Many people do not know where to find it until it is too late. If you have ever emailed yourself the phone bill or saved it digitally, check there.\n\nIn India, registering the IMEI on the government’s lost phone portal can help block the device across networks. Recovery is rare, but disabling misuse is still valuable.\n\nDo not forget the quieter risks\n\nPhones today hold far more than payment apps. Photos of documents, saved IDs, notes with passwords, workplace emails, and cloud access all matter.\n\nIf you had scans of Aadhaar, PAN, passports, or medical records on your phone, assume they may be exposed. Monitor accounts closely over the next few weeks.\n\nInform your workplace IT team if your office email or work apps were on the device. This is not about blame. It is about containment.\n\nWhat not to do in those first 30 minutes\n\nDo not log into random tracking links sent by strangers claiming they found your phone. Do not delay blocking access because you hope to recover it. Do not assume that a locked screen is enough protection.\n\nTime lost here is expensive.\n\nAfter the panic settles\n\nOnce accounts are secured, SIMs replaced, and passwords reset, take time to review your digital hygiene. Phones get stolen. What should not be stolen is your financial control.\n\nReduce the number of apps linked to payments. Use app-level locks. Keep emergency contact numbers written down somewhere offline. And know, in advance, which helpline you will call first.\n\nBecause when your phone disappears, clarity is more valuable than speed. And protecting your money is always more urgent than replacing a device.", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 12:35 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}
{"title": "IOC, BPCL announce fresh oil discovery in Abu Dhabi block after $166 million investment", "content": "Indian state-run refiners Indian Oil Corporation Ltd and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd on Wednesday announced a second oil discovery in an onshore exploration block in Abu Dhabi, strengthening their overseas upstream portfolio and India’s long-term energy security strategy.\n\nThe discovery was made by Urja Bharat Pte Ltd (UBPL), a 50:50 joint venture between IOC and BPCL’s exploration arm Bharat PetroResources Ltd.\n\nIOC said UBPL struck oil during drilling of exploratory well XN-79 02S in the onshore concession. This follows the first oil discovery made in early 2024 at the XN-76 exploratory well.\n\nThe joint venture was awarded Onshore Block 1 in March 2019 and has invested nearly $166 million in the exploration phase, which has now been completed.\n\nAccording to IOC, the first discovery was made in the unconventional Shilaif play, where oil flowed to the surface after successful hydro-fracturing operations, establishing the presence of unconventional oil resources in the block.\n\nThe second discovery, at XN-79 02S, flowed crude oil from the Habshan reservoir, marking the first oil find in this reservoir within the concession area.\n\nThe partners said the next stage will focus on appraisal to confirm the economic deliverability of the wells before any development decision.\n\nIOC said it is 'very positive' about the results and will move towards assessing commercial viability during the appraisal phase.\n\nThe onshore concession spans up to 6,162 sq km and grants UBPL 100 per cent concession rights, including equity oil. While volumes have not been disclosed, the discoveries carry strategic significance at a time when India is seeking to diversify crude supply sources and reduce exposure to import disruptions.\n\nFor IOC and BPCL, the finds also mark a milestone as international operators rather than passive partners—contrasting with earlier overseas assets where Indian firms often held minority stakes.\n\nBPCL, in a separate stock exchange filing, said its wholly owned subsidiary BPRL, through UBPL, announced the oil discovery in the operated onshore block on January 13.\n\nThe company said the development would supplement efforts to strengthen India’s energy security and added that UBPL is also advancing work on the existing Ruwais field while evaluating other hydrocarbon prospects within the concession area.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 15:47 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol News"}
{"title": "Budget 2026–27: India’s tariff-hit exporters seek duty rationalisation, carbon compliance relief", "content": "As Budget 2026–27 approaches, exporters from India’s tariff-hit sectors are seeking measures to remain competitive in overseas markets.\n\nOver the past year, global trade has been shaped by heightened tariffs, export controls, and increased use of trade‑remedy instruments, particularly by the United States, European Union, and China.\n\nSeveral import-dependent sectors in advanced economies are looking to diversify, most visibly in electronics, auto components, engineering goods, and select chemicals, opening new opportunities for Indian manufacturers and suppliers that can meet scale, quality, and compliance requirements, Gautam Khattar, Principal, Price Waterhouse & Co LLP, pointed out.\n\nIndian businesses are facing cost pressures across their value chains due to tariff changes, both domestically and in export markets. Higher customs duties on imported inputs, intermediates, and capital goods are raising landed costs and squeezing margins, particularly in electronics, automobiles, pharmaceuticals, speciality chemicals, machinery, and renewable energy.\n\nExporters are also hit by higher US tariffs, which in some sectors have doubled from 25 percent to 50 percent, eroding price competitiveness for textiles, apparel, gems and jewellery, leather, chemicals, auto components, and other manufactured goods, Khattar added.\n\nThose across gems and jewellery, textiles, and engineering goods are therefore emphasising the need for duty rationalisation, lower input costs, and simpler trade procedures in the Budget for 2026–27.\n\nThey are seeking lower import duties on raw materials, continued support for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME)-led exports, and measures that ease cash-flow pressures. Support for clean energy adoption and technology upgrades is also seen as important to meet global market requirements.\n\nKhattar said, “Continued, targeted production-linked incentive‑style incentives for tariff‑exposed sectors, along with simplified customs, digitisation, and stronger single‑window processes, can help firms scale, invest in technology, and manage higher input costs more efficiently.”\n\nTo be sure, India has already taken certain steps to protect tariff‑hit exporters with the Export Promotion Mission (EPM), backed by an outlay of Rs 25,060 crore, which includes a new interest subvention scheme to improve access to affordable credit for MSME exporters.\n\nPankaj Chadha, Chairman of EEPC India, says export support schemes must clearly include MSMEs, which make up the vast majority of engineering exporters.\n\nHe pointed out that the recently unveiled interest subvention scheme for exporters must explicitly cover all MSMEs, including those in the steel sector under Chapter 72, as they constitute the majority in the sector.\n\n“The omission of Chapter 72 from the current coverage should be rectified, since it has a significant adverse impact on a large number of downstream engineering exporters who are predominantly MSMEs,” Chadha said.\n\nHe also stressed the need for measures to help MSMEs invest in clean energy.\n\nEEPC India has asked for an enhancement in the weighted reduction incentive for rooftop solar installations for MSMEs. At present, normal depreciation on such assets is capped at 25 percent, which is insufficient to encourage adoption.\n\nHe proposed that 100 percent depreciation be allowed for rooftop solar installations for MSMEs. This measure would significantly improve cash flows, accelerate renewable energy adoption among small exporters, and enable MSMEs to lower their carbon footprint. Such support would also help Indian engineering exporters achieve a better CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism) value, thereby enhancing their competitiveness in markets such as the European Union, Chadha added.\n\nMost steel and aluminium products and their derivatives used in engineering goods are facing approximately 25 percent to 50 percent tariffs since mid-2025 from their largest trading partner, the United States.\n\nChadha, however, believes that Indian engineering exports will continue to grow by 4-5 percent to around $120 billion in 2025–26, despite tariffs, driven by diversification into new markets.\n\nThe US is the single-largest market for India’s textile and apparel exports, accounting for nearly 28 percent of total revenue in FY 2024–25, with exports totalling nearly $11 billion.\n\nWhile exporters have been trying to retain their US customers by sharing part of the costs and diversifying into newer markets, Ashwin Chandran, Chairman of the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI), said the sector looks to the upcoming Union Budget to provide policy and regulatory support to achieve India’s ambition of a $350 billion textile and apparel industry by 2030.\n\n“Measures that spur manufacturing, improve the availability of raw materials at internationally competitive prices, support MSMEs in transitioning to clean energy, and encourage innovation will be critical for the sector,” he said.\n\nCITI has proposed the removal of import duties on all varieties of cotton fibre, a revision of the MSP formula for cotton to align with international benchmark prices, and the launch of a Cotton Price Stabilisation Fund. The industry also seeks the introduction of a Green Technology Scheme to help MSMEs adopt clean energy, a new scheme to replace the Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme, promotion of indigenous textile machinery manufacturing, measures to address high power costs, and the establishment of a National Textile Fund.\n\nSuketu Shah, CEO of Vishal Fabrics Ltd., said last year’s Budget laid a strong foundation for the textile sector through improved exports, GST rationalisation, expansion of the PLI scheme, and faster execution of PM MITRA Parks.\n\nLooking ahead to Budget 2027, Shah stressed the need for support for modern machinery and technology to improve efficiency and scale. “Higher funding for R&D, a stronger focus on cotton productivity and quality, controlled garment imports, simpler export processes through BharatTradeNet, better access to export credit, and progressive labour policies can help India maintain its leadership in the global textile industry,” he added.\n\nOn trade facilitation, CITI called for the extension of RBI trade relief measures across the textile value chain, an increase in Basic Customs Duty on all types of knitted fabric to curb imports at unviable prices, reintroduction of the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS), and the extension of duty-free import facilities for Made-ups exporters.\n\nThe US accounts for nearly one-third of the country’s total gem and jewellery exports. In 2024–25, shipments to the US were valued at approximately $9.23 billion, highlighting the strategic importance of the market. US tariffs of 50 per cent from mid-2025 have raised jewellery prices for consumers, dampening demand and affecting the sector’s growth.\n\nDuring April–November 2025, India’s gem and jewellery exports to the US declined by nearly 44 per cent. The effect was even sharper in cut and polished diamonds, where exports fell by almost 59 per cent year-on-year.\n\n“Higher prices at the consumer level have led to more cautious buying and delayed purchases by US retailers, which has directly affected export volumes from India,” Sabyasachi Ray, Executive Director of GJEPC, told Moneycontrol.\n\nThe gems and jewellery industry said recent policy moves, priority-sector recognition under the Export Promotion Mission, the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Exporters, RBI trade-relief steps and smoother bullion imports via the IIBX—have eased credit access and compliance, especially for MSMEs.\n\nIn the Budget for 2026–27, the sector is seeking targeted duty rationalisation and procedural simplification, including rationalising import duties on diamonds and coloured gemstones, improving the duty drawback mechanism for gold and silver, extending support for lab-grown diamonds, and implementing practical SEZ reforms to improve operational flexibility.\n\nRay also pointed out that the sector is actively diversifying into new markets, and this has become one of the most important structural shifts in recent years.\n\n“Free Trade Agreements with the UAE, Australia, EFTA countries, the UK, and more recently Oman and New Zealand, are already improving competitiveness by reducing duties and easing trade barriers. With the Government of India currently negotiating 14 FTAs, we are confident that upcoming agreements will open new opportunities and strengthen India’s global export footprint,” Ray added.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 15:33 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Adrija Chatterjee"}

If your mobile number or address is outdated here, every other update becomes harder.\n\nUpdate your KYC at the bank branch or through net banking, depending on what is being changed. For mobile number or address changes, banks often require either in-person verification or Aadhaar-based authentication.\n\nOnce this is done, wait until the change is fully reflected in your bank’s records and you are receiving OTPs correctly on the new number. This usually takes one to three working days.\n\nThen fix Aadhaar and PAN-linked records\n\nIf your change involves name, address or mobile number, you should make sure Aadhaar is updated next. Many financial institutions now use Aadhaar-based eKYC or CKYC pulls in the background. If Aadhaar still has your old details, your new updates can get overwritten or rejected during verification.\n\nPAN itself does not store address or mobile number in a way that affects daily transactions, but the name and date of birth must match across all systems. If you have changed your name, this step becomes critical.\n\nOnce Aadhaar is updated, allow a few days for the change to propagate across authentication systems.\n\nUpdate your CKYC record before touching investments\n\nThis is the step most people skip and then regret. The Central KYC (CKYC) registry is what mutual funds, insurers, brokers and many NBFCs rely on. If your CKYC record still has old details, platforms may keep pulling outdated information even after you submit fresh documents.\n\nYou can update CKYC through any bank, mutual fund house, broker or insurer by submitting a KYC modification request. Once CKYC is updated, all linked institutions can theoretically fetch the new data.\n\nIn practice, this still takes a few working days to reflect everywhere, so patience helps.\n\nNow update mutual funds, brokers and demat accounts\n\nOnce your bank and CKYC records are clean, move to your investment platforms. Start with your demat and trading account, since these are tightly regulated and often act as reference points for other platforms. Then move to mutual fund platforms, AMCs, and investment apps.\n\nIn many cases, if CKYC is already updated, these platforms will auto-refresh your details or ask for minimal confirmation. If CKYC is not updated first, you may be forced into multiple separate KYC processes.\n\nInsurance should come last\n\nInsurance companies are slower to update records and less tightly integrated with real-time transaction systems. As long as your bank and CKYC records are correct, premium payments and claims are unlikely to get stuck. But mismatched details can create serious problems during claims or policy changes.\n\nUpdate insurers once the rest of the ecosystem is stable.\n\nWhy the sequence matters\n\nThe financial system today works like a hierarchy. Banks and Aadhaar sit at the base. CKYC sits in the middle. Investment and insurance platforms sit on top.\n\nIf you fix the top layers first, they often get overwritten or rejected when the base layers still show old data.\n\nA practical rule of thumb\n\nThink of KYC updates like fixing your address in a passport before changing it everywhere else. Get the root records right first, then let the rest follow.\n\nIt saves time, prevents freezes, and avoids the most common nightmare scenario: everything updated, but nothing matching.\n\nHere are three practical FAQs you can add at the end of the article in the same Mint-style tone.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\n1. Will updating KYC in one bank or platform automatically update it everywhere?\n\nNo. While many institutions pull data from CKYC or Aadhaar, updates do not propagate instantly or reliably across all platforms. Some platforms refresh data only when you initiate a transaction or raise a service request. That is why it is safer to update the core records first (bank, Aadhaar, CKYC) and then separately check your major investment and insurance accounts.\n\n2. How long does a full KYC update across the system usually take?\n\nIf there are no name changes or document mismatches, most updates can be completed within one to two weeks. Bank and Aadhaar updates may reflect within a few days, CKYC can take several working days, and investment and insurance platforms may take additional time to sync or verify changes.\n\n3. What is the most common mistake people make while updating KYC?\n\nThe biggest mistake is updating only one platform—such as a mutual fund app or broker—without fixing the bank, Aadhaar or CKYC records first. This often leads to repeated rejections, frozen transactions, or the system reverting to old details during the next verification cycle.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 16:31 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}
{"title": "HDFC Bank stock outlook: Brokerages bullish after Q3 profit beat, flag deposit growth as key monitor", "content": "Brokerages largely retained their bullish stance on HDFC Bank stock after its Q3 FY26 results, citing a modest earnings beat, improving margins and controlled costs, while continuing to flag deposit growth as the key near-term concern for the lender.\n\nOver the weekend, HDFC Bank reported an 11.5 percent year-on-year rise in standalone net profit to Rs 18,650 crore in Q3 FY26, aided by steady core earnings, margin expansion and lower credit costs. Net interest income grew 6.4 percent, while asset quality remained stable, with gross NPAs unchanged sequentially at 1.24 percent.\n\nAhead of the quarterly results,HDFC Bankshares had risen 0.55 percent on Friday to end at Rs 930.55 on the NSE. The stock has gained 13.7 percent in the last one year, outperforming benchmark Nifty 50, which has returned less than 11 percent during the same period.\n\nHDFC Bank stock call: Brokerages say 'buy'\n\nBrokerages stayed constructive on the stock even as they flagged moderating deposit growth and the need for stronger mobilisation to support a re-rating.\n\nCLSA reiterated its Outperform rating on HDFC Bank stock with a target price of Rs 1,200 per share, implying an upside of about 29 percent. The brokerage noted that the bank’s Q3 FY26 profit before tax was 5 percent ahead of estimates, aided by in-line pre-provision operating profit and lower-than-expected credit costs. Core operating profit came in 2 percent above expectations, driven by better net interest margins and cost control. CLSA highlighted an 8 basis point sequential expansion in margins, supported by lower deposit costs and the benefit of the CRR cut, even asloangrowth at 2.7 percent quarter-on-quarter lagged its estimate. Deposit growth moderated to 12 percent year-on-year due to curtailment of wholesale deposits, though average CASA growth improved during the quarter.\n\nAlso read|ICICI Bank stock outlook: Brokerages largely positive even after Q3 profit miss; CEO extension a key relief\n\nBernstein also maintained an Outperform rating with a Rs 1,200 target, pointing to consistent earnings delivery. The brokerage noted that Q3 earnings per share growth improved to 11 percent year-on-year from 10 percent in the previous quarter, supported by steady net interest income, marginal increase in the loan-to-deposit ratio, release of provision buffers, cost discipline and healthy fee income. Return on assets remained stable, it said.\n\nJefferies reiterated its Buy call and raised a slightly higher target price of Rs 1,240 per share, after the bank reported profit ahead of estimates. While core profit was largely in line after adjusting for provision releases and one-offs, Jefferies said deposit growth of around 12 percent remains a concern. The brokerage noted management’s clarification that the bank exited costlier deposits to improve margins, adding that a pickup in deposit growth would be critical for reducing the loan-to-deposit ratio and supporting a re-rating of the stock. Asset quality remained stable, it added.\n\nKotak Institutional Equities maintained an Add rating with a target price of Rs 1,050 per share, highlighting a 12 percent year-on-year growth in Q3 FY26 earnings. Operating profit rose 8 percent, while provisions declined 10 percent year-on-year. Loan growth stood at 12 percent, and net interest margins improved 10 basis points sequentially to 3.3 percent. Kotak said the bank’s guidance for above-industry growth in FY27 reflects the need for stronger deposit mobilisation going ahead.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

{"title": "Can you use a credit card beyond its sanctioned limit? Yes, but it comes at a cost", "content": "Most people assume a credit card simply stops working once the limit is exhausted. Swipe declined, transaction failed, end of story. In reality, that isn’t always how it works.\n\nSome credit cards do allow spending beyond the sanctioned limit. This feature can feel like a safety net in a tight moment. But it’s one that often creates more problems than it solves.\n\nWhat “over-limit” usage actually means\n\nUsing a credit card beyond its sanctioned limit doesn’t mean the bank has increased your limit permanently. It usually means the bank has temporarily allowed you to spend extra, either as a built-in feature or as a discretionary approval.\n\nThis is often described as an “over-limit facility” or “buffer”. It may apply automatically to certain transactions, especially recurring payments or large one-time spends. Many cardholders don’t even realise it exists until they see the statement.\n\nThe key point is that this extra spending is not free credit. It comes with conditions.\n\nWhy banks allow it in the first place\n\nBanks allow over-limit usage because it reduces transaction failures and keeps customers spending. From the lender’s perspective, it also increases revenue.\n\nOver-limit spends usually attract additional charges or higher interest. Some banks levy a one-time over-limit fee. Others simply apply interest from the day of the transaction, even if you otherwise pay your bill in full.\n\nIn short, flexibility for you often means higher earnings for the bank.\n\nThe costs people miss\n\nThe most obvious cost is the over-limit fee, which can be a flat amount or a percentage of the excess spend. But that’s not the only issue.\n\nInterest calculation can change. Even if you usually enjoy an interest-free period, that benefit may not apply to the over-limit portion. Interest may start accruing immediately.\n\nThere’s also a credit score impact. Consistently using more than your sanctioned limit signals financial stress. Credit bureaus track utilisation, and going over the limit can hurt your profile even if you repay on time.\n\nWhen over-limit usage can backfire quickly\n\nOver-limit usage becomes risky when it stops being occasional and starts becoming normal. What begins as a one-off emergency can turn into a habit of pushing limits every month.\n\nThis creates a cycle. Higher balances lead to higher interest. Higher interest reduces repayment capacity. And soon, the card shifts from convenience to liability.\n\nIt also reduces your buffer for real emergencies. When you actually need credit urgently, the card may already be stretched.\n\nShould you ever use this facility?\n\nIn rare situations, over-limit usage can act as a temporary bridge. A delayed reimbursement, a short-term cash mismatch, or an unavoidable expense can justify it.\n\nBut it should come with a clear plan to repay immediately, ideally before the statement is generated. Treating it as extra spending power without consequences is where trouble begins.\n\nIf you find yourself relying on it often, that’s a signal to reassess spending or look for more sustainable credit options.\n\nWhat’s a better alternative\n\nIf your credit limit feels consistently inadequate, it’s better to address that directly. Requesting a formal limit enhancement, restructuring expenses, or spreading costs across planned EMIs is usually cheaper and safer.\n\nUsing sanctioned credit intentionally is very different from leaning on unplanned excess.\n\nThe credit limit exists for a reason. Treating it as flexible by default usually works against you.", "company": "", "date": "January 18, 2026/ 11:01 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

Check how Section 54 applies to LTCG exemption", "content": "Today’s Ask Wallet-Wise breaks down how Section 54 applies to the LTCG exemption for an under-construction flat purchased in three instalments.\n\nAsk Wallet-Wise initiative offers expert advice on matters related to personal finance and money-related queries. You can email your queries to askwalletwise@nw18.com, and we will try to get a top financial expert to address.\n\nIn November 2025, I sold my residential house with Rs 20 lakh LTCG. I had booked an under-construction flat in February 2023, and the payment is being made in three annual instalments. Can payments made in 2023 and 2024 be used to claim the LTCG exemption under section 54, though the booking was made outside the two-year window?\n\nExpert’s Advice: Section 54 provides for exemption for profits made on the sale of a residential house property, which is held for two years or more, provided the capital gains are invested for acquiring or constructing a residential house within the prescribed time period.\n\nThe exemption can be claimed if a ready-to-move-in residential house is purchased within two years from the date of sale of the residential house. Even if a residential house is purchased within one year before the date of sale of the house, the exemption can be claimed.\n\nIf the assessee chooses to construct a house on their own or books an under-construction property, the exemption can be claimed provided the construction is completed and possession is obtained within three years from the date of sale of the residential house. The start date of construction or the timing of payments is not material. What matters is that the house is completed and possession is received within the prescribed period.\n\nSo the payment already made during 2023 and 2024 can be taken into account for computing the amount of long-term capital gains available, as the limit of two years does not apply here in case of booking of an under-construction property.\n\nPlease note that since the indexation benefit is not available for computing the amount required to be invested, you will have to invest the plain long-term capital gains and not the indexed long-term capital gains as mentioned by you.\n\nFor claiming the exemption, it is not necessary that the same money as realised on the sale of the house property gets invested. The exemption is available as long as the amount of investment in the new residential house is equal to or more than the plain long-term capital gains realised.\n\nPlease ensure that you get possession of the booked flat within three years from the date of sale of your residential house, else the income tax department may refuse to give you the benefit of exemption, and the matter may get litigated.", "company": "", "date": "January 18, 2026/ 11:35 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Balwant Jain"}

{"title": "EPFO, India Post launch free doorstep Digital Life Certificate service for EPS pensioners: How to book slot", "content": "In a move to help elderly and vulnerable pensioners who do not have smartphones or are unable to visit banks or EPFO offices for submitting their Digital Life Certificates or Jeevan Praman, the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has rolled out a free doorstep Digital Life Certificate service in partnership with India Post Payments Bank (IPPB). Under this initiative, postmen and dak sevaks will visit pensioners’ homes and complete the DLC process — at no cost to the pensioner.\n\nWhat is Jeevan Pramaan/ DLC\n\nJeevan Pramaan is a biometric-enabled, Aadhaar-based digital service that allows pensioners to prove their “aliveness” without physically visiting their pension office. It is meant for pensioners of the Central and State Governments, as well as other government organizations whose Pension Sanctioning Authority (PSA) is onboarded on the Jeevan Pramaan platform.\n\nHow the free service works\n\nUnder the new arrangement, IPPB staff will visit pensioners whose Digital Life Certificate is due or about to become due. The DLC will be registered at the pensioner’s residence itself, and the pensioner will not have to pay anything for the service.\n\nThe cost of the service will be borne centrally by EPFO through its Central Pension Processing and Review Centre (CPPRC). Importantly, IPPB will be paid only for “successful DLCs”, as defined under EPFO’s Standard Operating Procedure.\n\nWhen is a DLC treated as successful?\n\nAs per EPFO’s Standard Operating Procedure (SoP), a DLC is treated as successful only if:\n\nOnly after this approval will EPFO release service charges to IPPB.\n\nHow pensioners can request a home visit\n\nPensioners or their family members can request the free doorstep DLC service by calling IPPB’s customer care number033-22029000. Once the request is registered, a postman or dak sevak will be scheduled to visit the pensioner’s home to complete the process.\n\nWhat EPFO offices have been instructed to do\n\nEPFO has issued detailed instructions to its offices to ensure smooth implementation of the scheme. Zonal offices have been asked to closely monitor compliance by field offices, review pending DLC cases every month, and track progress regularly. They have also been directed to conduct surprise checks to verify whether death intimation cases are being handled properly and to take prompt action against officials if such cases remain unattended for unreasonable periods.\n\nRole of regional and district offices\n\nRegional and district EPFO offices have been told to actively educate pensioners and their families about self-submission of DLCs using smartphones through Face Authentication Technology on the Jeevan Pramaan or UMANG apps. EPFO has also asked offices to play instructional videos from its YouTube channel at public relation offices and during pension outreach events.\n\nOffices must display banners highlighting the availability of the free doorstep DLC service through IPPB along with the customer care number. If a pensioner expresses difficulty in submitting the DLC or cannot visit a bank or EPFO office, they should be guided to avail the home visit facility.\n\nClearing long-pending DLC cases a priority\n\nEPFO has directed its offices to compile and share addresses of pensioners whose DLC has been pending for more than two years with IPPB to enable doorstep visits. Special priority has been given to cases where DLCs have been pending for over five years, followed by cases pending between two and five years.\n\nThe organisation aims to clear all long-pending DLC cases by March 2026.\n\nAdditionally, EPFO has also emphasised the need for quick action when the death of a pensioner is reported. In such cases, pension should be started immediately for the next eligible beneficiary. Where there is no eligible beneficiary, the Pension Payment Order (PPO) must be permanently closed so that it does not continue to show up as a pending DLC case.", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 15:58 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Manisha Lal Khandpur"}

The MoU was exchanged in the presence of Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, Industries Minister T.R.B. Rajaa, senior government officials and Sarvam AI co-founder Pratyush Kumar.\n\nAccording to the announcement, the Sovereign AI Park will be developed as a purpose-built district integrating AI compute infrastructure, secure data frameworks, model research laboratories and innovation clusters. It will also house a dedicated Institute for AI in Governance, aimed at developing and deploying AI systems for public-sector use while ensuring compliance with data security and ethical standards.\n\nThe park is designed to operate as a “full-stack” ecosystem where data storage, model training and deployment are conducted within the state’s jurisdiction.

The scope of the tender pertained to the provision of statewide network connectivity for the Government of Karnataka offices, along with operations and maintenance services for a period of five years. The last date for bid submission was January 14, 2026, it added.\n\nTCIL alleged that Cisco failed to provide mandatory bid-related documents and manufacturer authorisation form within stipulated timelines despite repeated reminders, and later attempted to impose new and \"extraneous\" conditions at the final stage of bid submission and actions TCIL described as a breach of assurance and detrimental to fair competition.\n\nThere was no official comment on the issue from TCIL.\n\nResponding to a PTI query on the issue, Cisco, in an email statement, said it \"abides by applicable local laws and regulations in all the markets we operate in, and we set out intentionally high standards in our Code of Business Conduct to which we hold ourselves\".\n\n\"As we continue to engage with Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd on this matter, we remain focused on delivering industry-leading products and services to customers across India,\" the Cisco statement said.\n\nIn its order, TCIL alleged that Cisco's conduct amounted to deliberate non-responsiveness and the creation of artificial entry barriers at the closing stage of bid submission.\n\nTCIL said the tender was of strategic and economic importance to it, and that it is in good faith that the company had approached Cisco Systems India (OEM) as early as December 18, 2025, seeking OEM support required in government procurement, including technical compliance documents, product data-sheets, solution inputs and issuance of Manufacturer Authorisation forms.\n\nBut in spite of TCIL's repeated requests and follow-ups, Cisco failed to provide the requisite bid-related documents within a reasonable time - this despite being well aware of the bid submission deadline.

{"title": "MC EXCLUSIVEExpert panel may design assured 10-year payout products under NPS: PFRDA chairman", "content": "India’s pension regulator is working towards introducing National Pension System (NPS) products that can give retirees a fixed monthly income for a defined number of years, rather than for life, as part of a shift to strengthen the pension payout phase.\n\nAn expert committee set up by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) will explore a minimum assured return scheme (MARS), that could offer certainty of income, such as a fixed Rs 10,000 a month, for a limited period like 10 years, chairman Sivasubramanian Ramann said in an interview toMoneycontrol.\n\n“The aim of this committee is to bring in different types of products and also attempt a minimum assured return scheme called MARS, where such schemes can bring me pension on an assured basis,” he said.\n\nIt will give customers more choice at the time of retirement, especially those who may not want or need a lifetime annuity immediately. The aim is to design assured monthly income products that offer certainty for fixed years rather than lifetime payouts, he said.\n\nMARS: assured income but not for life\n\nThe expert committee has been asked to look at the payout side of pensions, an area that has received less attention so far compared to the accumulation phase.\n\nThe assured income may not necessarily be for life, he said. “It may not be for life, but it will mean that every month I can get 10,000 rupees because I have bought that product. The assured return may be for a 10-year period,” he said.\n\nIt will allow people to mix and match products depending on age and needs. “I may go to the annuity at 75 or 80, because at those ages, annuity works better in my favour. Till then I may want some income which I will get from some other pension payout product,” Ramann said. “So we have to provide choices to the customers. It is for them to choose what kind of product they want at which point of time.”\n\nHe described the committee’s work as crucial for PFRDA. “Till now we have only been focussing on the accumulation part. We have not been focussing on the pension payout part. So this committee will bring that,” he said, adding the panel is not being rushed and may “run for a while”.\n\nFalling bond yields and asset diversification\n\nPFRDA is also reviewing its investment guidelines to allow wider asset diversification, as government bond yields are expected to trend lower over time.\n\nRamann said yields on government securities are likely to decline gradually. “We are all expecting GSEC yields to come down as it would in a developed country. Today we are at 6.53 percent, tomorrow it will probably come down,” he said.\n\nLower bond yields could affect long-term pension returns, making diversification more important. “How do we make sure that the asset allocation that is available for NPS holders becomes robust enough so that we can at least try and continue to give them good returns,” he said.\n\n“Just recently we allowed 1 percent of the total AUM to be in AIFs. Now that is asset diversification,” Ramann said. “So, like that, we have to think what are the other assets that are available.”\n\nDigital push through Pension Bazaar\n\nSpeaking about the new digital distribution platform Pension Bazaar, the PFRDA chairman said digital distribution and long-term engagement are critical for expanding pension coverage.\n\n“We need more and more distribution agencies that can take the product across largely on digital rails,” he said. “We have to be able to deliver our financial products at the lowest cost. In spite of the fact that we have increased the distribution commissions a little bit in NPS, it is still one third and one fourth of the mutual fund commissions. So we must have, to the extent possible, digital delivery of the product.”\n\nPensions are a long-journey product for distributors and customers alike. “This is a product for 25 years, 35 years… because they are there for so long, you can keep engaging with the customer,” Ramann said, pointing out that distributors will see pensions as “a perfect hook for holding the customer” over decades.\n\nThe launch of Pension Bazaar will expand pension distribution through low-cost, digital channels, he said. Ramann said digital delivery is essential to keep costs down and make distribution viable. “Only then can we ensure that the distribution system keeps active with the NPS,” he said.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 14:27 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Meghna Mittal"}
{"title": "Can your will really secure your pet’s future? How to plan care, custody and costs", "content": "For many households, a pet is not just an animal that lives at home. It is family. Yet very few owners ever pause to think about an uncomfortable question: what happens to the dog or cat if something happens to you?\n\nWho will take them in? Who will pay for food, vet visits and sudden medical emergencies? And can a will really make sure a pet is cared for the way you would want?\n\nThe honest answer is yes — but not in the way most people imagine.\n\nWhy you can’t leave money to your pet\n\nThe first surprise for many pet owners is a legal one. Under Indian law, only a person or a legal entity can inherit property. An animal, no matter how loved, cannot own assets.\n\nSo a line in your will that says, “I leave Rs 5 lakh to my dog,” simply does not work.\n\nWhat you can do is leave money to a person and clearly state that this money is meant to be used only for your pet’s care. That difference may sound technical, but it is what makes the arrangement enforceable rather than just hopeful.\n\nWhat a sensible pet plan in a will looks like\n\nIn practice, a will that properly provides for a pet usually has three parts. First, it names a guardian — the person who will actually take the animal home and look after it.\n\nSecond, it sets aside a specific amount of money or asset to cover the pet’s expenses. This is meant to pay for food, vaccinations, grooming and, just as importantly, medical treatment if something goes wrong.\n\nThird, it gives the executor of the will the job of making sure that this money is used only for the pet. Sometimes this is done by releasing the money in parts rather than all at once.\n\nThis may sound formal, but it is what turns good intentions into something that actually works.\n\nWhy “I trust them” is not a plan\n\nMany people assume that if they leave some money to the person who agrees to take their pet, everything will be fine. Legally, however, that person is under no obligation to spend the money on the animal unless the will clearly says so.\n\nTying the money to a specific purpose — and giving the executor some oversight — reduces the risk that the funds are quietly diverted elsewhere.\n\nHow much should you leave?\n\nThere is no standard number. A young, healthy cat is a very different financial responsibility from an ageing large-breed dog with health issues.\n\nThink in terms of annual costs: food, routine vet visits, vaccinations, grooming and boarding. Then add a buffer for medical emergencies and remember that prices will rise over time. If your pet is young, you may be planning for a decade or more of expenses.\n\nSome people leave a lump sum. Others prefer a more structured arrangement where money is used gradually.\n\nLife is unpredictable. The person you choose as your pet’s guardian today may move abroad, fall ill or simply be unable to take on the responsibility when the time comes.\n\nYour will should name at least one alternate caregiver. And it is always better to have these conversations in advance rather than leaving behind a surprise responsibility.\n\nThe usefulness of a “letter of wishes”\n\nMany pet owners also leave a separate note describing the pet’s habits, food preferences, medical history and daily routine. This is not legally binding, but it can make the transition much easier — and far less stressful for the animal.\n\nIf your will does not mention your pet, the law treats it like any other movable property and passes it on to your legal heirs. There is no obligation on them to keep the animal or care for it in any particular way.\n\nThis is how many pets end up being rehomed or, in the worst cases, abandoned — even when the owner could easily have planned for a different outcome.\n\nYour will can protect your pet’s future, but only if it is written with a bit of care. You cannot make your pet an heir. But you can choose a caregiver, set aside money for its care and build in simple safeguards to make sure that money is actually used for that purpose.\n\nWith a few sensible clauses — and some honest conversations — you can make sure your companion is looked after even when you are no longer around.\n\n1. Can I make my pet a beneficiary in my will?\n\nNo. Under Indian law, a pet cannot own property or inherit assets. You have to leave the money to a person and state clearly that it is meant for the pet’s care.\n\n2. What if the person I name as caregiver can’t take the pet later?\n\nThat is why you should always name at least one backup caregiver. Without one, your pet may end up with your legal heirs by default.\n\n3. How do I make sure the money is actually spent on my pet?\n\nBy linking the funds to a clear purpose in the will and giving the executor the power to oversee or release the money in stages.\n\n4. Do I need a trust for this?\n\nUsually, no. A well-drafted will is enough for most families. A trust only makes sense if the amount involved is large or the arrangements are complicated.\n\n5. What happens if I die without a will?\n\nYour pet becomes part of your movable property and goes to your legal heirs, who are not legally required to keep or care for the animal.", "company": "", "date": "January 12, 2026/ 18:01 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

{"title": "Trading Plan: Can Nifty 50 reclaim 25,900, Bank Nifty move beyond 59,700?", "content": "The sharp recovery from the dayâ€™s low, coupled with a bullish reversal pattern (piercing line) formation after a five-day correction, has raised hopes of a further rally in the Nifty 50, though the India VIX appears to be continuing its rise towards the 12 zone. If the index extends its gains, the 25,900â€“26,000 levels will be crucial to watch in the upcoming sessions. However, immediate support is placed at 25,700. Meanwhile, the Bank Nifty is expected to face an immediate hurdle at 59,700, as sustaining above this level could open the door for a move beyond the 60,000 zone. On the downside, the 59,200â€“59,000 range is likely to act as immediate support, followed by 58,700 as a key support zone, experts said.\n\nOn January 12, the Nifty 50 rose 107 points (0.42 percent) to 25,790, while the Bank Nifty climbed 199 points (0.34 percent) to 59,451. However, market breadth remained favourable for bears, with about 1,866 shares declining against 1,044 advancing shares on the NSE.\n\nNifty Outlook and Strategy\n\nJay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities\n\nThe Nifty 50 recovered quite sharply from its dayâ€™s low and managed to close well above the 25,700 level, which was a critical support of the last series. A close above 25,700 indicates that a short-term bottom is in place, as long as the 25,450 level is held.\n\nIndia VIX closed 4.05 percent higher at 11.37, which has moved up as anticipated and reached near its short-term target of 12. From here on, the VIX is likely to see some further upside at least until Budget Day and may test the 13 level on the upside. However, it is unlikely to fall below 10, so going forward, some more volatility in the markets cannot be ruled out.\n\nAs per the options data for this series, the 26,000 level is the key level to watch. Until the Nifty closes above it, the short-term range for the index is likely to remain between 26,000 and 25,500. Hence, a buy-on-dips and sell-on-rallies strategy is advisable until there is a breakout or breakdown from this range.\n\nKey Resistance: 26,000, 26,100\n\nKey Support: 25,600, 25,450\n\nStrategy: Buy Nifty Futures on dips in the range of 25,650-25,700, with a stop-loss below 25,450, for target of 26,000 and 26,100.\n\nJigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi\n\nIn the most recent trading session, the Nifty staged a sharp recovery from the dayâ€™s low, rebounding over 300 points and settling just below the 25,800 mark. Technically, the index found strong support in the 25,450â€“25,500 zone, which coincides with a previous demand area from November 2025 and the flat Ichimoku cloud, reinforcing its importance as a support base.\n\nOn the 30-minute chart, the DMI has indicated a positive crossover, while the RSI has moved above the 50 level, signalling improving momentum and the likelihood of continued recovery in the coming sessions.\n\nAdditionally, the Nifty Putâ€“Call Ratio (PCR) stands at 0.88 after plunging to 0.50 intraday, reflecting a more balanced and comfortable market positioning. Overall, these supportive technical indicators point towards a resumption of bullish momentum in the near term.\n\nKey Resistance: 25,900, 26,000\n\nKey Support: 25,500, 25,400\n\nStrategy: Buy Nifty Futures in the 25,800â€“25,700 zone, with a stop-loss of 25,550, targeting 26,200.\n\nShitij Gandhi, AVP - Technical Equity Research at SMC Global Securities\n\nMarket sentiment improved after encouraging remarks on a potential trade deal by the US Ambassador. Technically, the rebound has helped the Nifty reclaim short-term supports, indicating that selling pressure may be easing. The index is now expected to consolidate with a positive bias as long as it holds above the key support zone of 25,500â€“25,400.\n\nOn the upside, the 25,900â€“26,000 band remains an immediate resistance zone where supply is likely to emerge. A sustained move above this zone could open the door for a gradual up-move towards 26,200, while failure to hold supports may lead to renewed range-bound activity.\n\nKey Resistance: 25,900, 26,000\n\nKey Support: 25,600, 25,400\n\nStrategy: Buy Nifty Futures on dips near 25,750, with a stop-loss below 25,500, targeting 26,150.\n\nBank Nifty - Outlook and Positioning\n\nJay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities\n\nThe Bank Nifty also recovered sharply from lower levels and managed to close above 59,000, a level it has been holding since the December series. Hence, the 59,000 level on a closing basis is a key support, and unless it closes below this level for two consecutive days, the short-term range is likely to remain between 59,000 and 60,000.\n\nThere was significant Call unwinding and Put additions in the last trading session, indicating that short-term support is now at the 59,000 level. As long as this level is held, the Bank Nifty is likely to trade sideways to positive.\n\nKey Resistance: 59,700, 60,000\n\nKey Support: 59,200, 59,000\n\nStrategy: Buy Bank Nifty Futures on dips near 59,300, with a stop-loss of 58,900, targeting 59,700 and 60,000.\n\nJigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi\n\nIn the latest trading session, the Bank Nifty witnessed a sharp recovery from the dayâ€™s low, rebounding over 600 points and settling near the 59,450 mark. Technically, the index found strong support in the 58,800â€“58,900 zone, which coincides with a previous demand area from December 2025, the Ichimoku cloud, the 50 DEMA, and weekly pivot support, making this zone a crucial base for the ongoing recovery.\n\nOn the 30-minute chart, the DMI has shown a positive crossover, while the RSI has moved above the 50 level, indicating strengthening momentum and the possibility of further upside in the coming sessions. Additionally, the Bank Nifty Putâ€“Call Ratio (PCR) stands at 0.90 after dipping to 0.80 intraday, suggesting a more balanced market positioning. Overall, these supportive technical signals point towards a continuation of bullish momentum in the near term.\n\nKey Resistance: 59,700, 60,000\n\nKey Support: 58,900, 58,700\n\nStrategy: Buy Bank Nifty Futures in the 59,600â€“59,500 zone, with a stop-loss of 59,100, targeting 60,300.\n\nShitij Gandhi, AVP - Technical Equity Research at SMC Global Securities\n\nIn line with the Nifty, the Bank Nifty index also recovered from its intraday lows, supported by selective buying in banking stocks amid improved global cues. From a technical standpoint, this pullback has enabled the index to decisively reclaim its 35-day exponential moving average on the daily chart, thereby keeping the broader trend constructive.\n\nThe Bank Nifty is likely to maintain a mildly positive bias as long as it sustains above the 59,000â€“58,800 support zone. On the upside, immediate resistance is seen in the 59,800â€“60,000 range, followed by a stronger supply area near 60,200. A sustained breakout above these levels could revive bullish momentum, while a breach of key supports may lead to continued consolidation within a defined range.\n\nKey Resistance: 59,900, 60,100\n\nKey Support: 59,400, 59,200\n\nStrategy: Buy Bank Nifty Futures on dips near 59,400, with a stop-loss below 59,100, targeting 59,900.", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 04:56 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar"}
{"title": "Why coping with inflation feels easy, until it suddenly isn’t", "content": "Most people do not underestimate inflation because they are careless. They underestimate it because the math does not feel intuitive. A 5 or 6 percent rise sounds manageable. Prices creep up quietly. Salaries rise occasionally. Life goes on. And so the thought takes hold that things will somehow work out.\n\nThe problem is that inflation does not work in straight lines. It compounds. And compounding is where “I’ll manage” starts to break down.\n\nWhy annual inflation feels harmless\n\nWhen inflation is quoted as an annual number, it feels abstract. Five percent does not sound like a crisis. On a monthly basis, it is barely noticeable. A grocery bill rises by a few hundred rupees. School fees go up slightly. Fuel prices fluctuate but eventually settle.\n\nBecause the increase is gradual, the brain treats it as noise rather than risk. We adjust behaviour instead of confronting the math. We switch brands, cut a few expenses, postpone purchases. That creates the illusion of control.\n\nBut inflation is not testing adaptability. It is testing arithmetic.\n\nThe compounding effect most people ignore\n\nHere is the core mistake. People think inflation adds up. It does not. It multiplies.\n\nAt 6 percent inflation, prices double roughly every 12 years. At 7 percent, it is closer to 10 years. That means something that costs Rs 50,000 a month today will cost close to ₹1 lakh a decade from now, without any change in lifestyle.\n\nThis is where “somehow” fails. Very few incomes double every decade in real terms. Even fewer do so consistently.\n\nManaging small gaps does not prepare you for large ones\n\nMost households manage inflation in the early years by closing small gaps. You save a little less. You stretch assets. You dip into bonuses. You delay upgrades.\n\nThat works when the gap is marginal. It fails when the gap becomes structural.\n\nOver time, inflation creates a permanent mismatch between what your money earns and what your life costs. Once that mismatch sets in, there is no one-time fix. Every year starts slightly behind the last.\n\nWhy savings lose quietly, not dramatically\n\nInflation rarely destroys savings overnight. It erodes them silently.\n\nA fixed deposit that feels safe can still lose purchasing power if returns barely match inflation before tax. A savings account that looks stable is actually shrinking in real terms. The balance stays the same. What it can buy does not.\n\nBecause nothing visibly breaks, people assume the system is holding. In reality, they are standing still on a downward-moving escalator.\n\nThe lifestyle creep trap\n\nInflation becomes especially dangerous when combined with lifestyle creep.\n\nAs income rises, expenses rise too, often faster than inflation. Better housing, better education, better healthcare, better convenience. Each choice feels reasonable on its own. Together, they raise the inflation baseline of your life.\n\nNow you are not just fighting general inflation. You are fighting personal inflation, which is usually higher.\n\nWhy future-you cannot “figure it out later”\n\n“I’ll manage somehow” often relies on an unstated assumption: that future income will solve the problem.\n\nThis ignores two realities. First, income growth tends to slow with age. Second, inflation-driven costs like healthcare and support services rise fastest precisely when earning ability peaks or declines.\n\nBy the time the pressure becomes obvious, flexibility is lower. Big changes are harder. Risk-taking capacity is reduced.\n\nWhat actually works instead\n\nBeating inflation does not require predicting the future. It requires respecting the math.\n\nYou need assets that compound faster than inflation over long periods. You need buffers for costs that rise faster than average inflation. And you need to regularly test your assumptions by asking one uncomfortable question: if prices double from here, does this plan still work?\n\nIf the answer depends on “somehow,” it usually does not.\n\nWhat actually works when inflation will not slow down\n\nOnce you accept that inflation is not a temporary inconvenience but a structural force, the response has to move beyond vague thrift and hopeful budgeting. The first shift is mental. Instead of asking how to “manage” rising costs, the better question is how to make your money adjust automatically when prices rise.\n\nThe most effective defence against inflation is income that grows faster than it. For salaried workers, this means actively planning job changes, skill upgrades, or role shifts every few years rather than waiting for annual increments to compound. In many Indian sectors, staying put for too long is the fastest way to fall behind inflation, even if the job feels stable. For freelancers and small business owners, it means revisiting pricing more frequently and resisting the instinct to absorb cost increases on behalf of clients.\n\nOn the spending side, inflation punishes fixed habits. Expenses that feel “locked in” are often more flexible than they appear. Insurance premiums, broadband plans, school transport, subscriptions, maintenance contracts and even grocery choices tend to drift upward quietly. A once-a-year audit of these categories can free up meaningful cash without touching essentials. The aim is not austerity, but elasticity.\n\nSavings strategy matters just as much. Parking long-term money in instruments that barely beat inflation is effectively a slow leak. While safety is important, especially for emergency funds, long-term goals need exposure to assets that historically outpace inflation over time. This is less about chasing returns and more about avoiding guaranteed loss of purchasing power.\n\nDebt also needs a rethink. Inflation can work in your favour if loan EMIs are fixed and income rises, but it becomes dangerous when interest rates reset higher or when lifestyle upgrades are financed with short-tenureloans.Before taking on new debt, it helps to run a simple stress test: would this EMI still feel manageable if food, fuel and school costs rise another 10 to 15 percent?\n\nFinally, inflation planning works best when it is honest. Many households underestimate how much their lifestyle actually costs because they remember last year’s numbers, not today’s. Writing down current, real expenses often reveals that the margin for error is already thin. That clarity, uncomfortable as it may be, is what allows for course correction while there is still time.\n\nInflation rarely creates sudden crises. It creates slow ones. The households that cope best are not the most frugal, but the ones that adjust early, revise assumptions often, and stop relying on optimism to do the work of planning.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 17:10 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

{"title": "Using your credit card to earn flights and hotel nights, without extra spending", "content": "Most people don’t think of their credit card as anything more than a convenient way to pay. It’s for groceries, fuel, online shopping, subscriptions, the occasional big bill. The card gets paid off, the cycle repeats, and that’s that.\n\nWhat often gets missed is that the same routine spending can quietly add up to free flights, hotel nights and travel perks. Not through tricks or hacks, but simply by paying attention to how rewards actually work.\n\nIt’s not about spending more\n\nThis is where many people get it wrong. Travel rewards aren’t meant for people who spend recklessly. They work best for people who already have steady monthly expenses and pay their bills on time.\n\nYour electricity bill doesn’t care how you pay it. Neither does your grocery store or fuel pump. If those payments are already happening, routing them through the right card earns you something back. Over months, that “something” stops being trivial.\n\nWhy most points never turn into trips\n\nPlenty of people earn points and still never travel on them. The reason is simple. They redeem badly.\n\nUsing points for shopping vouchers or catalogue items usually gives poor value. It feels satisfying in the moment, but it’s the slowest way to use rewards. Flights and hotel stays are where points stretch the most, especially when ticket prices spike.\n\nPeople who get real value usually have a destination in mind long before they redeem anything. That focus stops points from expiring unused or being burned on low-value options.\n\nPicking the wrong card costs more than you think\n\nA cashback card is easy. You see the benefit immediately. Travel cards are slower and demand patience.\n\nAirline cards work if you fly the same carrier often. Hotel cards make sense if you keep returning to the same chain. General travel cards suit people who want flexibility and don’t want to commit to one brand.\n\nThe mistake is choosing a card because of a flashy sign-up bonus and ignoring how it earns rewards after the first few months. A boring card that fits your spending pattern usually wins in the long run.\n\nThe perks people forget to count\n\nFlights and hotel nights get all the attention, but some of the most useful benefits are quieter. Airport lounge access. Priority boarding. Extra baggage. Hotel upgrades. Late check-outs.\n\nYou don’t notice their value until you travel without them. Over a few trips, these perks often save more than the card’s annual fee — especially for people who travel even a little regularly.\n\nThe one rule that makes or breaks everything\n\nThis part isn’t negotiable. If you pay interest, travel rewards stop being “free”. They become very expensive souvenirs.\n\nPeople who benefit from rewards pay their full bill every month. They don’t stretch spending to earn points. They don’t carry balances. They don’t swipe just because there’s an offer running.\n\nThey use the card as a payment tool, not aloan.\n\nFewer cards, faster rewards\n\nAnother thing most people don’t like hearing: too many cards dilute rewards.\n\nSpreading spending across four or five cards feels smart, but it slows everything down. Points accumulate slowly and never quite reach redemption levels. Concentrating spending on one or two good cards usually works better.\n\nIt’s less exciting, but far more effective.\n\nWho this actually works for\n\nIf you rarely travel and prefer simplicity, cashback cards are probably a better fit. There’s nothing wrong with that.\n\nBut if you already take one or two trips a year, or fly for work, or stay in hotels anyway, travel rewards can quietly lower those costs. Not dramatically overnight, but steadily.\n\nCredit cards don’t magically create free holidays. What they do is reward attention. If you choose the right card, redeem sensibly, and stay disciplined,\n\nyour everyday spending can quietly chip away at the cost of travel you were going to pay for anyway.\n\nNo hacks. No gimmicks. Just fewer wasted points — and one less flight you have to pay for in cash.", "company": "", "date": "January 17, 2026/ 13:01 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

Salem has said his sentence could not exceed 25 years as per the assurance given by India to Portugal for his extradition.”First of all, how do you calculate 25 years from 2005?” a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta asked the counsel appearing for Salem.\n\nThe apex court was hearing Salem’s plea against a July last year order of the Bombay High Court which said prima facie it appeared that the period of 25 years was yet to be completed. During the hearing in the apex court, Salem’s counsel said as per the calculation, he has completed 25-year jail term.”You were taken in actual custody on which date?” the bench asked.The counsel said Salem was taken into custody on November 11, 2005.”So you calculate 25 years including your remission?” the bench asked.”Your (Salem) conviction is also under TADA (Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act).\n\nLet us see the prison rules of Maharashtra.

In fact, last week itself we were ready, but the industry came back with some suggestions,” said Manoj Kumar, speaking at an industry conference. “We are now trying to incorporate those inputs, and soon you will hear from us on what we have done on categorization,\" he added.\n\nKumar said the exercise is complex, as SEBI has to balance broader capital formation with investor protection, especially at a time when domestic mutual fund inflows and retail participation are at record levels.\n\n“The challenge is how to categorize small-cap, mid-cap and large-cap stocks in a way that is feasible for the long term. Some people suggest a micro-cap category, but recently you would have seen that we had to intervene in one micro-cap,” he said. Recently,  Motilal Oswal AMC announced that they are stopping inflows into their Nifty Microcap 250 Index fund following consultations with SEBI.\n\nKumar noted that regulatory decisions may not always find immediate acceptance among market participants but stressed that long-term market stability remains the regulator’s priority.\n\n“I am not assuring that whatever we do will always be accepted by the industry. Many times what we do is not immediately accepted, but in the long run, the industry agrees with us,” he said.\n\nIn 2017, SEBI introduced major Categorization and Rationalization of Mutual Fund Schemes, standardizing categories like Equity, Debt, Hybrid, Solution-Oriented, and Other Schemes, and implementing a one-scheme-per-category limit for fund houses, plus defining Large, Mid, and Small-cap stocks for clarity and uniformity in equity fund mandate.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 19:27 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Anishaa Kumar"}

{"title": "Axis Bank's Neelkanth Mishra weighs on markets 'over-trusting' US-India trade talks", "content": "Markets have been reacting sharply to potential US-India trade developments although over short-runs, but Neelkanth Mishra, Chief Economist at Axis Bank, Head of Global Research & Whole Time Director at Axis Capital, expressed surprise at the intensity of the concern. “I am alarmed and amazed at how meaningful people think it is. But I have said this again… the US government will be forced to levy a flat tariff on everyone, in which case there’s no point for India needing ground on anything if there’s no benefit to be had,” he said. The statement underscores a growing divergence between market sentiment and the underlying fundamentals of the Indian economy.\n\nAlongside Mishra, Gautam Chhaochharia of UBS highlighted that India’s fundamentals remain strong, and flows are likely to respond to actual earnings growth rather than headline trade news. Mishra noted that foreign direct investment (FDI) has been inching up, with repatriations rising from USD 20 billion to USD 50 billion per year, and argued that as earnings growth returns to 10 to 15%, India will naturally attract capital flows.\n\nChhaochharia  added that the broader emerging market context matters: FDIs are not just looking at India but at all EMs. “For FDIs to come back in an absolute sense right here, we need earnings growth to pick up. India still represents one of the long-term growth visibility markets for FDIs,” he said. Both strategists suggested that temporary trade noise, including tariffs or delays in US-India agreements, is unlikely to meaningfully deter long-term flows.\n\n“FDIs are not just looking at India — China, Korea, Taiwan, and other EMs are all competing for capital. For flows to shift meaningfully to India, earnings growth and domestic demand need to be durable, not headline-driven,\" said Mishra.\n\nAdding to the discussion, Sajid Chinoy of JP Morgan flagged that markets tend to underestimate Trump-era tariff efficacy. “Now there is section 122, there’s section 232, also 301 and 338… in the US, everything is centralized, an investigation can take 48 hours. So we just need to be a little wary,” he said. Chinoy emphasized that while tariffs or country-specific trade actions create headline risk, the underlying fundamentals of India’s economy, including domestic consumption and credit growth, remain far more important for market performance.\n\nConsumption and Credit as Growth Drivers\n\nThe panel also discussed domestic drivers of growth. Chinoy highlighted that while rural demand and auto sales are showing signs of pickup, “everyone expected this quarter to be strong… the question is, three quarters from now, will we still be seeing consumer durables doing well and will this broaden out beyond autos?” He termed the current uptick a “sugar rush,” emphasizing the need for sustained demand to support private investment and corporate earnings.\n\nChhaochharia  pointed to accelerating credit as a key enabler for consumption and investment. “Monetary tailwind becomes effective when credit growth accelerates. It is only now, in the last fortnight of December, that what used to be 0.8% fortnight over fortnight became 3%. When people borrow, they spend, and that drives the next level,” he said, describing the beginnings of a potential virtuous cycle for the economy.\n\nSectoral and Corporate Implications\n\nOn the earnings front,  Chhaochharia highlighted financials as the most directly poised to benefit from the current cycle, given relatively attractive valuations compared to the last decade. Other sectors, like power, utilities, and equipment, could see growth driven more by stock-specific factors than broad macro trends.\n\nMishra also pointed to the importance of private capex, “Whenever someone says capex is not happening… look at BSE 200 companies’ investing cash flows — it has been growing faster than nominal GDP. Investment is trying to pick up, and the last fortnight of credit growth shows it.”\n\nGautam added that while short-term uncertainties, including tariffs or geopolitical shocks, grab attention, structural trends remain favorable. “This is still the early part of the five-year term for reforms and investment. The roadmap for fiscal consolidation, credit expansion, and domestic consumption sets the stage for sustained growth. If these drivers continue over the next three to four quarters, India’s growth story will play out regardless of headline noise from abroad,” he said.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 14:19 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol News"}

Cumulatively they were up nearly 129 percent for the April–December period at $7.77 billion against $3.39 billion in the year-ago period even after the end of the festive season when shipments usually peak.\n\nThe sharp rise stands out against the broader trend in import growth.\n\nGold imports fell 12.1 percent in December to $4.13 billion, with a modest cumulative rise of 1.8 percent, while petroleum imports edged up nearly 6 percent to $14.41 billion, even as cumulative shipments fell 4.3 percent to $135.4 billion.\n\nThe surge in silver imports has been driven by a sharp rise in prices, closely linked to global developments.\n\nChina, a major silver producer and processor, announced stricter approval-based export rules effective January 1, 2026, limiting shipments to approved firms.\n\nPrices had risen in anticipation of the move, while geopolitical events and safe-haven demand added pressure.\n\nAs of January 15, silver was trading at around $91.6 an ounce after hitting a near-record $93.7 the previous day, driven by safe-haven buying amid geopolitical tensions and global market uncertainty.\n\nSilver is expected to remain firm through 2026, likely staying above historical levels, though short-term fluctuations are possible.\n\nThe white metal has become more crucial as a key industrial input, with solar manufacturing accounting for about 17 percent of the global demand in 2025, up from under 10 percent earlier in the decade.\n\nElectrical and electronics applications consistently make up roughly a quarter of demand, highlighting silver’s growing role beyond investment and jewellery.\n\nThe broader trade picture underscores the trend.\n\nIndia’s merchandise trade deficit widened in the first nine months of the current fiscal.

Among sectors, Metal and PSU Bank indices rallied over 2 percent, whereas the IT index lost the most, shedding over 1 percent.

Buying interest emerged in pockets such as metals, oil and gas, and consumer durables, helping limit the downside after recent corrections.\n\nMarket sentiment remains fragile, with both indices having declined in six of the last seven sessions amid concerns over US tariff measures, geopolitical tensions and persistent foreign portfolio outflows. FPIs have sold nearly â‚¹16,600 crore worth of equities so far in January, following heavy outflows in 2025. Additional volatility was driven by the advancement of the weekly derivatives expiry to Wednesday, while positive cues from Asian markets provided some support.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the Nifty managed to hold above the 25,620â€“25,715 support zone.

{"title": "Jefferies says new labour codes may add to margin pressures for IT companies, sees lower wage hikes at senior level", "content": "Global brokerage firm Jefferies on Monday said India’s new labour codes are likely to add to margin pressures for information technology (IT) firms and could lead to lower wage hikes, particularly at the senior level.\n\nThe labour codes, which came into effect in November, mandate that employee wages must be at least 50 percent of cost to company (CTC), with benefits such as provident fund and gratuity to be calculated on wages. This is expected to raise recurring employee costs for IT companies and also result in a large one-time financial impact.\n\n\"New labour codes will add to the margin pressures from slower revenue growth, AI-led business mix change and potentially higher onsite wage hikes in FY27 and FY28 due to changes in H-1B visa norms,\" Jefferies said in a note.\n\nIt added that a 2 percent increase in Indian employee costs could reduce FY27 earnings estimates by 2-4 percent for IT companies. Firms are likely to offset part of the impact through lower wage hikes, especially at senior levels.\n\nIT services firm HCLTech reported an 11.2 percent decline in consolidated net profit to Rs 4,076 crore for the October-December quarter of FY26, mainly due to a one-time provision of Rs 719 crore linked to the implementation of the new labour codes.\n\nThe Noida-based company had posted a net profit of Rs 4,591 crore in the same quarter last year.\n\nExcluding the one-time impact, HCLTech said net profit would have stood at Rs 4,795 crore. Regulatory filings showed that the impact on earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) was Rs 956 crore.\n\nHCLTechsaid the one-time impact under the labour code amounted to about Rs 900 crore, and that this would not affect its hiring plans.\n\nChief People Officer Ram Sundararajan said the company has factored in all required provisions in the current quarter’s pay changes and does not expect any further significant incremental costs related to the new rules.\n\nCountry’s largest IT services exporterTata Consultancy Services(TCS) also reported a 13.91 percent decline in profit for the December quarter at Rs 10,657 crore, largely due to the one-time impact of the labour codes.\n\nThe company said the implementation of the new labour codes during the quarter led to a statutory impact of Rs 2,128 crore.

{"title": "How to Repay Your Home Loan Early: A Guide For Homeowners16 January, 2026 | 17:51 IST", "content": "See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market\n\nDiscover the secret world of unlisted shares — analyse India's top pre-IPO companies and invest before they hit the markets\n\nOwning a home is a cherished dream for many Indians. At the same time, it is a tremendous task financially and most people usually take out a home loan to fulfil it. The tenure of a home loan can go up to 30 years.\n\nFor many, the burden of a home loan can feel overwhelming. Though it allows you to buy or build a home, the thought of paying EMIs for decades could be challenging.\n\nTo reduce the financial burden, home loan early repayment could be a suitable option. It can save you interest costs and relieve you of debt. Here are some ways to successfully achieve home loan early repayment.\n\nThere are several banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) which offer home loans in India. To get the best deal, you must compare the terms and conditions which different lenders prescribe for their loans.\n\nIn case you want a personal loan, you can visit the Moneycontrol app. You can borrowup to Rs 50 lakhswith interest rates starting from 10.5% per annum. You won’t be asked to provide any collateral for these loans and the entire application process is 100% digital.\n\nHere are some of the things you can do for early home loan repayment:\n\nIf you have taken a floating rate home loan, then you will not be charged a penalty for making a prepayment. You can take advantage of this provision to clear your debt early. Prepayments directly lower the principal, lowering future interest calculations.\n\nIf your income increases, you consider increasing your EMI correspondingly. If you pay higher EMIs consistently, you can reduce your loan tenure significantly. However, it is important to do thorough planning, as there are other expenses you have to take care of as well.\n\n3. Opt for a Shorter Loan Tenure\n\nIf you want to reduce the duration for which you are indebted, one of the most obvious things to do is to choose a loan with a shorter tenure. Shorter tenures mean higher EMIs but lower total interest. You need to do proper financial planning to ensure that it is the right option for you.\n\nUse bonuses, tax refunds, or other windfalls to make lump-sum prepayments. For example, if you receive a bonus, use it for prepaying the principal. Unexpected financial gains, such as mutual fund returns or inheritance, can be directed towards loan prepayment.\n\n5. Earn Additional Income And Cut Unnecessary Expenses\n\nYou can supplement your primary income with side hustles or investments to fund prepayments. Further, you can also review your monthly expenses to see if you can cut out unnecessary expenses so that you can increase the prepayment amount.\n\nCheck loan options for all needs\n\nFactors to consider before home loan early repayment\n\nPrepayment Charges:Some fixed-rate loans may have prepayment penalties. You must study the terms and conditions of the loan thoroughly to decide whether you should opt for prepayment.\n\nTax Benefits:Under the Income Tax Act, 1961, you can claim a tax deduction of up to Rs 2 lakh for home loan interest and up to Rs 1.5 lakh on the principal. Early repayment may reduce these benefits. So, it is important to compare the tax savings against interest savings.\n\nOther Financial Goals:It is crucial to balance home loan repayment with goals like retirement, education or healthcare. You must do proper financial planning before starting prepayments.\n\nEMI Calculators:Use online calculators from banks like and online platforms to calculate savings from prepayments and increasing the EMI.\n\nEmergency Fund:Before you start home loan early repayment in India, you must build an emergency fund which can sustain you for at least six to twelve months. This will keep you prepared for unexpected worst-case scenarios.\n\nIf you are looking for a personal loan with attractive terms and conditions, you can check the Moneycontrol app. You can borrowup to Rs 50 lakh from top lendersthrough the app. The interest rates start from 10.5% per annum. The loan application process is entirely paperless, which ensures quick approval and disbursement.\n\nTo conclude, repaying your home loan early requires discipline, planning and smart financial choices. By making regular prepayments, increasing EMIs and increasing your monthly savings, you can clear your debt early.\n\nExploreTop Lenders for Instant Loan upto\n\nFibe(EarlySalary Services Pvt.

By the 1990s, this focus shifted toward migrants from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.\n\nDuring the 1960s campaign against South Indian migrants, a slogan — “Uthaao lungi, bajaao pungi” (loosely translated as “Lift the lungi, play the pungi”) — was popularised.

{"title": "Budget 2026 unlikely to offer tax relief; focus may shift to asset monetisation, credit revival: Ace investors", "content": "Veteran investor Raamdeo Agrawal, Chairman and Co-founder of Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said there was little chance of any tax hike or meaningful tax relief in the upcoming Union Budget, as the government has already undertaken substantial direct and indirect tax cuts and is now focused on reviving growth. They were speaking at a CNBC-TV18 event in Mumbai on January 13.\n\n“There is no question of raising the tax rate, because otherwise they would not have brought down the GST from 28 percent to 18 percent. It’s quite a budget in itself,” Agrawal said, adding that the government has already “opened the hands”.\n\nHe said raising taxes would not help if economic growth remains weak. “If the economy is not growing, any kind of tax rate is nominal. First, you’ve got to get the tailwind happening in the economy,” he said.\n\nAgrawal said reviving credit growth was critical and pointed out that credit flow had earlier been curtailed, possibly to control inflation. “They have beaten down the credit flow for whatever reason. Now, they’ve got to get it back to 40 to 50 percent credit flow. That will give you 11 to 12 percent nominal growth and then it’s all evergreen,” he said.\n\nHe said recent policy actions show that stimulus has already started. “Look at what they do, not what they say. What they’ve done is stimulate,” Agrawal said. He pointed to a cumulative 125 basis point cut in interest rates, credit growth improving from 8 to 9 percent to 10.5 to 12 percent, a sharp reduction in GST rates, and an increase in the income tax exemption limit from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 12 lakh.\n\nOn the budget outlook, Agrawal said expectations should be moderate. “What more can they do? They can further cut interest rates by another percentage or so. Toh kuch kharab nahi hoga budget mein, kuch achha ho sakta hai, kaafi nahi,” he said. He added that the government’s priority remains getting taxation right rather than rolling back existing levies.\n\nManish Chokhani, Director at Enam Holdings, said the scope for further tax cuts is limited. “They have already cut your direct taxes. They have already cut your indirect taxes. So, there is nothing to look forward to on that side,” he said.\n\nChokhani said the next phase of resource mobilisation may have to come from the public sector, particularly through asset sales. “The resource-raising exercise must come now from the public sector. If some of those assets go cheap through private hands, like it started in 2000–03 in the Vajpayee era, it re-ignites animal spirits,” he said.\n\nHe said private sector investment remains subdued amid global uncertainty. “The private sector is clearly not opening the purse strings. They are very uncertain about what’s happening in the world right now,” he said, adding that steps such as privatisation, disinvestment, or new PLI-type schemes could help revive sentiment.\n\nChokhani also said recent labour reforms have added to cost pressures. “Even the labour codes which have come have increased the accounting costs for companies. So, you need to give a profit fillip to the private sector,” he said.\n\nOn taxation, Chokhani said it is not a primary concern for him as an investor. “Tax, I don’t honestly think about. Let’s first think about making money,” he said. He added that optimism is integral to the profession. “You wake up optimistic every day looking at the bright side of things. I don’t wake up worrying and chewing my nails.”\n\nOn capital gains, Chokhani said any rollback in rates would at best provide a short-term sentiment boost but would not materially change market outcomes. “If you don’t make money, then how does it matter? It is a sentiment booster for sure, but I don’t think it’s a game changer,” he said, especially at a time when government revenues are under pressure.\n\nHe termed capital gains taxation a “red herring”, saying it creates unnecessary friction, particularly for foreign investors. “It creates friction for everybody, including foreigners, in fund accounting, NAV calculation and taxes when money comes in and goes out. It’s just wasting time,” he said.\n\nFrom an investor’s perspective, Chokhani said returns matter far more than marginal changes in tax rates. “I’d rather make a 25 percent gain and pay a 12.5 percent tax than make a 12 percent gain and pay a 10 percent tax,” he said, adding that the real focus should be on reviving animal spirits among entrepreneurs, as markets ultimately ride on business growth rather than tax tweaks.", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 18:11 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Khushi Keswani"}
{"title": "When money gets tight, these are the expenses you should pause first", "content": "When money suddenly feels tight, most people react the same way. They start slashing wherever they can. Dining out goes first. Then shopping. Sometimes even investments or insurance payments get paused “just for a few months”.\n\nThat instinct is understandable. It is also where many people make mistakes that cost them far more later.\n\nCutting expenses quickly is often necessary. Doing it blindly is not. The goal in a cash crunch is not to reduce spending at any cost, but to buy breathing room without damaging your future finances.\n\nThe first thing to understand is that not all expenses are equal. Some are flexible. Others look flexible but carry long-term consequences if you tamper with them.\n\nStart with expenses that do not lock you in\n\nThe safest cuts are the ones that do not create obligations or penalties later.\n\nEating out, food delivery, impulse online shopping, and convenience spending are the obvious starting points. These are variable costs. Cutting them immediately improves cash flow, and restarting them later does not come with a penalty.\n\nSubscriptions fall into the same category. Streaming services, apps, premium memberships, cloud storage you barely use. Individually, they seem small. Together, they quietly drain monthly cash. Pausing or cancelling them buys instant relief with almost no downside.\n\nTravel and discretionary outings can also be postponed without long-term harm. You are delaying consumption, not destroying value.\n\nThese cuts are uncomfortable but reversible. That matters.\n\nBe cautious with anything that affects your credit\n\nThe worst place to cut in a hurry is debt repayment.\n\nSkipping EMIs, paying only the minimum due on credit cards, or delayingloanpayments may seem like an easy fix. In reality, they are expensive decisions disguised as relief.\n\nMissed or delayed payments hurt credit scores. Revolving balances rack up interest quickly. Once credit health is damaged, it takes years to repair, long after the original cash crunch has passed.\n\nIf you need to reduce debt-related outflows, restructuring is safer than skipping. Extending loan tenures, consolidating payments, or formally speaking to lenders is very different from simply not paying on time.\n\nCash flow relief should never come at the cost of credit damage unless there is no alternative.\n\nDo not raid long-term protection\n\nAnother common mistake is stopping insurance premiums or dismantling long-term financial safety nets.\n\nHealth insurance, term insurance, and basic medical cover are not “optional” expenses, even when money is tight. Cancelling them saves cash today but exposes you to risks that can wipe out years of savings overnight.\n\nThe same applies to dipping into emergency funds meant for genuine crises. Using them to fund lifestyle expenses defeats their purpose. Once depleted, they are rarely rebuilt quickly.\n\nIf you must touch savings, start with surplus cash or low-impact buffers, not protection layers that are hard to replace.\n\nInvestments need nuance, not panic\n\nCutting investments requires careful thinking.\n\nPausing discretionary investments like additional mutual fund purchases or optional SIP top-ups is usually fine in the short term. These are flexible by design.\n\nStopping core retirement contributions, however, can have long-term costs that are not immediately visible. Missed compounding does not announce itself. You only realise the damage years later.\n\nIf contributions must be reduced, reduce amounts rather than stopping entirely. Maintaining continuity matters more than maintaining the original number.\n\nLook at fixed expenses last, not first\n\nRent, school fees, essential utilities, and basic transportation are harder to cut quickly. They often require negotiation or structural changes.\n\nThat does not mean they are untouchable, but they should not be the first lever you pull. Renegotiating rent, switching schools, or changing commute patterns takes time and emotional bandwidth.\n\nFast expense cuts should prioritise speed and reversibility. Structural changes belong to a second phase, once panic has passed.\n\nThe principle that matters most\n\nIn a financial squeeze, the instinct is to focus on amounts. What matters more is impact.\n\nCut what is easy to restart. Protect what is hard to rebuild.\n\nShort-term survival decisions should not sabotage long-term stability. The goal is to get through the tight phase with your financial foundations intact, not emerge debt-free but exposed.\n\nMoney stress often demands speed. Good financial decisions demand restraint. The balance between the two is what separates temporary difficulty from lasting damage.", "company": "", "date": "January 12, 2026/ 15:00 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}
{"title": "GOLD RATE IN INDIA", "content": "See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market\n\nDiscover the secret world of unlisted shares — analyse India's top pre-IPO companies and invest before they hit the markets\n\nOne of the most precious and expensive metals, gold is considered very significant in India and is also one of the prime investment options at the present time. Not just in the form of jewellery. but gold is also valued in forms of art and coins. Despite a continuous hike in gold prices, people in India continue to invest in gold on a regular basis. Gold prices in India keep changing due to multiple factors including global market condition and the strength of the US dollar, thus leaving varying impact from city to city depending on demand and supply in local markets. If you are also planning to invest in gold, consider taking a look at the following details.\n\nBefore knowing gold rates in India, it is important to know the difference between 24-carat and 22-carat gold. While 24-carat gold is a 100 percent pure form of gold with no trace of any other metal, 22-carat gold has traces of alloyed metals like silver or copper and has 91.67 percent pure gold.\n\nThere are several factors that affect gold rates in India including fluctuations in the global market to the strength of the USD, import costs, interest rates on banks' fixed deposits, economic stability, seasonal prices, inflation and demand-supply, among others. While high inflation rates increase the demand for gold and vice versa, its price also shoots up as with an increase in demand. Apart from a few global conditions, the international spot price of gold also affects the metal value of gold in India. Just like any other product, demand and supply also affect gold prices. With a rise in demand and supply for gold, its prices have also increased.\n\nOn the domestic front, gold futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) rose Rs 3,698, or 2.7 per cent, over the past week, touching a record high of Rs 1,43,590 per 10 grams on Wednesday\n\nEven as buying gold has turned out to be a secure form of investment in India, more and more people are engaging themselves in buying gold. With gold rates skyrocketing in recent times, it is important to take note of a few things before investing in precious metals.\n\nYESTERDAY Silver Rate Per Gram/Kg\n\nDetermined by a combination of factors including international market behaviour, demand, supply and inflation, among others, gold prices in India are indicated by the Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd. and the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX).\n\nFactors that potentially affect gold rates in India are fluctuations in the global market, strength of the USD, import costs, interest rates on banks' fixed deposits, economic stability, seasonal prices, inflation and demand-supply.\n\n24-carat gold is considered to be the purest form with 100 percent gold and no traces of any other metal.\n\nAuspicious festivals like Dhanteras, Makar Sankranti, Akshaya Tritiya, Dussehra, and Diwali are considered the best time to buy gold in India. It is primarily because jewellers offer a range of discounts on making charges.\n\nThe purity of gold can be determined by checking the 'Hallmark' sign on the jewellery. Hallmarked jewellery certifies the claimed purity of gold and further engraves the purity level along with the name of the retailer to ensure that customers are not duped.\n\nIn a bid to bring transparency into jewellery shopping, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has been designated to implement hallmarking of gold jewellery to ensure that customers buy the purest form of gold. Through this process, the proportionate content of precious metals is determined and recorded through specific marks such as the BIS logo, the purity of the metal and a unique HUID number.\n\nTo ensure that customers are not duped and sold off with an impure form of gold that has a mix of other alloyed metals, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has been designated to implement hallmarking of gold jewellery.\n\nBeginning with the custom tax that the government imposes for importing gold into the country, it is followed by other taxes levied by sellers including the GST, making charges, and TDS.\n\nThe fluctuation in the international markets largely impacts the price of gold in India. For example, any rise in the US Fed interest rate will result in money flowing into government securities and the banking system from gold reserves. India is one of the largest gold importers and sees a major impact with fluctuations in gold prices on global markets.\n\nBeing the safest and profitable form of investment in India, investing in gold will not only come as an asset but is also considered superior to currency. It is one of the few assets that is tangible and creates a perception of safety among investors. Both purchasing and selling gold are very easy in India.\n\nGold investment in India is popular and can be done through various avenues. These include purchasing gold jewelry, coins, bars, or investing in gold ETFs. Gold jewelry serves a dual purpose of adornment and investment, although factors like making charges should be considered. Gold coins and bars can be obtained from authorized dealers or banks in different weights. Alternatively, investors can opt for gold ETFs, which offer liquidity and convenience. The government also issues Sovereign Gold Bonds periodically, providing an alternative investment option. It's important to track gold prices as they are subject to fluctuations influenced by various factors. Proper storage, such as bank lockers or secure vaults, is essential for physical gold investments. Consulting with a financial advisor is recommended to make informed investment decisions based on individual financial goals and risk tolerance.\n\nFurthermore, the Gold Monetization Scheme introduced by the government allows individuals to deposit their idle gold with banks and earn interest on it. This scheme aims to put the idle gold held by households to productive use. However, it's important to note that gold investments come with risks. While gold has historically been considered a safe haven asset, its value can also fluctuate based on international market trends, currency exchange rates, and economic factors. Therefore, it's prudent to carefully monitor gold prices and assess the market conditions before making any investment decisions. Seeking guidance from a financial advisor or investment professional can provide valuable insights and help align your gold investment strategy with your overall financial goals.\n\nMoneycontrol makes no guarantee or warranty on the accuracy of the data provided on this site, the prevailing rates are susceptible to change with Market value and provided on an as-is basis.

After opening on a weak note, Nifty slipped into weakness in the early part of the session. A sharp recovery has emerged from the lows of 25473 levels and the market sustained the gains till the end.\n\nA long bull candle has been formed on the daily chart with long lower shadow. Technically, this market action is indicating significant turnaround in the market for the short term. This is positive indication one may expect further upside in the short term.\n\nThe underlying trend of Nifty seems to have turned up post sharp weakness of last week. Having recovered from the key lower levels decisively, Nifty could advance towards the next hurdle of 26000-26100 levels in the next few sessions.\n\nShrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities\n\nToday, the benchmark indices witnessed a sharp recovery from the lower levels. The Nifty ended 107 points higher, while the Sensex was up by 302 points.

Technically, after an early morning intraday sharp selloff, the market took support near 25,500/82,700 and bounced back sharply. From the day's lowest point, the market bounced back over 300/1,200 points, which is largely positive.\n\nWe are of the view that the intraday market texture is positive, but buy on dips and sell on rallies would be the ideal strategy for day traders. On the downside, 25,650/83,500 and 25,600/83,300 would act as key support zones, while 25,900-25,950/84,300-84,500 could serve as immediate resistance areas for the bulls. However, below 25,600/83,300, sentiment could change. If that happens, traders may consider exiting their long positions.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

{"title": "Budget 2026: Telcos pitch sharp licence fee, GST cuts to ease financial stress to fund network investments", "content": "India’s telecom industry has urged the government to ease regulatory and tax burdens in the Union Budget 2026–27, warning that sustained investments in next-generation networks hinge on immediate fiscal relief to support the broader goal of Viksit Bharat.\n\nThe Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), which represents Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, has called for a steep cut in licence fees to 0.5%–1% to cover administrative costs and a reduction in GST on spectrum and regulatory payments to 5% from the current 18%.\n\nS.P. Kochhar, Director General of COAI, said the measures are revenue neutral for the government and would significantly ease cash-flow pressures on operators, freeing up capital for network expansion, faster 5G rollouts and future technologies.\n\nPush to cut regulatory levies\n\nA key demand from the industry is a sharp reduction in licence-related payments. At present, telecom operators pay a licence fee comprising a 3% levy on adjusted gross revenue (AGR) along with a 5% contribution to the Digital Bharat Nidhi. COAI has proposed lowering the licence fee component to between 0.5% and 1%, arguing that this would be adequate to meet administrative costs.\n\nThe industry body has also sought a pause on further contributions to the Digital Bharat Nidhi until the existing, unutilised corpus is fully deployed by the Department of Telecommunications, noting that continued collections add to financial strain without commensurate sectoral benefits.\n\nGST relief and ITC utilisation\n\nCOAI has also flagged persistent GST-related challenges, particularly the build-up of unutilised input tax credit (ITC) across the telecom ecosystem. To address this, it has proposed exempting regulatory payments such as licence fees, spectrum usage charges (SUC) and auctioned spectrum from GST.\n\nAs an alternative, the association has suggested lowering the GST rate under the reverse charge mechanism on spectrum payments, licence fees and SUC to 5% from 18%, saying the move would curb ITC accumulation while remaining revenue neutral for the exchequer. It has also recommended allowing telecom operators to use existing ITC balances to discharge GST liabilities under the reverse charge mechanism, reducing cash outflows and improving liquidity.\n\nRecalibrating spectrum policy\n\nBeyond immediate fiscal relief, COAI has called for a broader reassessment of spectrum pricing and assignment models, pointing out that telecom has evolved from a standalone sector into a horizontal, value-added enabler for industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, fintech and governance.\n\nGiven this expanded role, the association said spectrum policy needs recalibration to ensure affordability and long-term sustainability as India continues to scale its digital infrastructure.\n\nThe government is expected to consider these proposals as it finalises the Union Budget for 2026–27, balancing fiscal discipline with the need to accelerate digital growth.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 11:34 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Danish Khan"}

{"title": "HDFC Bank shares rise today after CLSA reiterates ‘outperform’ call, erases gains later; check upside", "content": "Shares of HDFC Bank pared early gains and were trading flat by afternoon on Tuesday, even as CLSA reiterated its bullish stance on the stock, with as much as 28 percent upside. The brokerage played down investor concerns around deposit growth and the elevated loan-to-deposit ratio.\n\nHDFC Bankstock was last seen at Rs 936.5 in afternoon trade, little changed on the day, after touching an intraday high of Rs 947.7 in the morning, when it was up about 1.1 percent. The stock remains up around 15 percent over the past year, outperforming the Nifty 50’s roughly 11 percent gain over the same period.\n\nBroader market was trading weak on Tuesday, with benchmark indices BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 shedding about 0.5 percent each, amid a volatile session. Banking index Bank Nifty lost 0.1 percent in the afternoon after staying in green through the day.\n\nIn a note, CLSA reiterated its ‘Outperform’ rating on HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 1,200 per share. The brokerage noted that the stock has corrected 6-7 percent since the Q3 FY26 operational update. It described that this correction comes amid a growing frustration among investors over moderating deposit growth and a rise in the loan-to-deposit ratio to about 99 percent.\n\nAlso read|Cash segment margin likely to reduce, SEBI panel endorses margin rationalisation proposal\n\nHowever, CLSA argued that most of these concerns are either misconceived or temporary. It said expectations of immediate margin improvement following the merger -- despite refinancing wholesale bonds with deposits -- have been misplaced, and that FY27 is more likely to mark a ‘bounce-back’ year for the bank.\n\nThe brokerage also highlighted valuation comfort, noting that after the recent correction, HDFC Bank is trading at a 10-12 percent price-to-book discount to ICICI Bank, and said it is an opportunity for investors to look past near-term noise and focus on the franchise’s longer-term strengths.\n\nHDFC Bank, India’s largest private sector lender by market capitalisation at about Rs 14.4 lakh crore, is currently valued at around 19.9 times earnings, with a dividend yield of roughly 1.18 percent.

{"title": "Moneycontrol Pro Market Outlook | Heavyweight earnings to guide market direction", "content": "The truncated trading week saw Indian equity markets navigate in a narrow band, ultimately ending unchanged. The convergence of early corporate earnings announcements, persistent apprehensions surrounding trade tariffs, and unrelenting selling pressure from Foreign Institutional Investors collectively weighed on market sentiment.\n\nThe Nifty50 managed a modest advance of 0.04 percent by week's end, while broader market indices slipped marginally into negative territory. Beneath this calm surface, however, significant sectoral rotation was underway.\n\nConsumer Durables, Realty, Pharmaceutical, and Healthcare stocks each declined approximately 2 percent, with the Auto index retreating 1.75 percent and Media stocks falling 1 percent. Conversely, PSU Banking and Metal stocks surged 4.5 percent each, while the Nifty IT index climbed 2.8 percent.\n\nFIIs maintained their withdrawal from Indian equities, offloading shares worth Rs 14,265.58 crore during the week.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, US indices finished mixed, with small-cap stocks notably outperforming benchmark indices. The earnings season commenced with major banks reporting fourth-quarter results, prompting varied market responses.\n\nLooking forward, markets are likely to contend with the ripple effects of the US President's decision to impose a 10 percent tariff on the European Union following disagreements over Greenlandâ€”a development expected to reverberate across global markets. Domestically, benchmark indices may experience heightened volatility as several Nifty heavyweights released earnings over the weekend, with additional results scheduled for announcement in the coming days.\n\nThe Nifty index continues to consolidate beneath its support line, signalling that bearish forces remain in command. In the near term, the recent low of 23,473 represents a critical support level, while 26,030â€”the 61.8 percent retracement of the latest declineâ€”stands as a significant resistance threshold. A decisive break beyond this range could trigger a short-term directional move; absent such a breakout, the Nifty is likely to trade sideways or continue its downward trajectory.\n\nThe market-wide Open Interest Put-Call Ratio (OI PCR) is approaching the lower boundary of its typical range at 0.72. Historically, the OI PCR has fallen as low as 0.66, suggesting room for further short-term correction in the broader indices. For a genuine reversal in the Nifty index, a turnaround in the OI PCR must materialise first. A decisive close above 26,030 would confirm a price action reversal.\n\nNevertheless, the short-term outlook for the Nifty remains bearish, as the OI PCR continues its decline and the index trades below its support trendline.\n\nSource:web.strike.money\n\nThe percentage of Nifty constituents trading above their 20-day Simple Moving Average showed marginal improvement this week, though the indicator remains positioned in the middle of its historical range. With the Nifty index having breached its trendline support, the short-term trend has turned decisively downward. For a meaningful bottom to establish itself, this breadth indicator would need to decline below the 20 levelâ€”a threshold it has yet to reach.\n\nUnder current conditions, the market favours a sell-on-rise strategy until the Nifty index closes above 26,030, which represents 61.8 percent of the recent decline. Until such a reversal materializes, traders should approach rallies with caution.\n\nSource:web.strike.money\n\nFIIs currently hold a net short position of 1,90,375 contracts in index futures. This represents a slight reduction from the record high of 1,99,134 contractsâ€”adjusted for the recent lot size changeâ€”reached earlier this week. The percentage of long positions in index futures remains in single digits, reflecting exceptionally bearish sentiment among FIIs.\n\nHistorically, such extreme positioning has often preceded double-digit returns over the subsequent three to four months once a market bottom forms. However, as previously noted, two key short-term indicatorsâ€”the market-wide OI PCR and the percentage of stocks trading above their 20-day SMAâ€”continue to suggest that further downside remains likely in the near term before any sustainable recovery can take hold.\n\nSource:web.strike.money\n\nNifty 50 â€“ The Benchmark Index ended flat, up by +0.04% this week and closed at 25694.35.\n\nThe Nifty IT index continues to gain momentum and relative strength, with strong outperformance this week. Nifty Bank and Nifty Private Bank saw a turnaround in momentum this week, with sharp improvements in relative strength. Nifty Metal saw significant momentum and relative strength improvements, pushing this index into the leading quadrant this week.\n\nNifty Oil and Gas has entered the weakening quadrant this week, as it continues to lose momentum and relative strength. The Nifty Infrastructure index also continues to lose momentum and relative strength after entering the weakening quadrant last week. Nifty Auto has seen a meaningful decline in relative strength this week. If this trend continues, the index is expected to underperform in the coming weeks. Nifty PSU Bank has shown initial signs of a turnaround in momentum and relative strength this week, but we need to see further evidence.\n\nImproving Quadrant: The Nifty Financial Services index is back in the improving quadrant and has seen improvements in both momentum and relative strength. If this trend continues, it can enter the leading quadrant in the coming weeks and outperform the benchmark index.\n\nNifty Pharma saw a significant turnaround in momentum and relative strength, pushing it back into the lagging quadrant from the improving quadrant. Nifty MNC continues to gain momentum, but relative strength has not improved yet. If relative strength improves, the Nifty MNC could be an interesting sector to watch in the near term. Nifty PSE and Nifty Media continue to gain momentum, and both indices have seen a minor improvement in relative strength this week, making them interesting sectors to watch. Nifty Energy, Nifty Realty, and Nifty FMCG continue to deteriorate in both momentum and relative strength. Nifty Consumer Durable was showing signs of a comeback, but that did not last long, as relative strength has weakened once again this week.\n\nAmong the stocks expected to perform better during the week are Federal Bank, AU Small Finance Bank, LTI Mindtree, Bank of India, PNB, MCX, Vedanta, Nestle, and Alchem Labs.", "company": "", "date": "January 19, 2026/ 07:57 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Shishir Asthana"}

{"title": "Trade setup for January 16: Top 15 things to know before the opening bell", "content": "The market remained range-bound at 25,600â€“25,900 (i.e., within the 100-day EMA and 50-day EMA) for the fourth straight session, with the Nifty 50 closing one-third of a percent lower on January 14. Technical and momentum indicators, along with an elevated VIX, continued to signal caution for bulls as the market awaits further corporate earnings. The index is expected to get a firm direction only after it convincingly breaks the above-mentioned range on either side. Below 25,600, the 25,450 level will be crucial to watch; however, on the higher side, above 25,900, a move towards 26,000â€“26,100 cannot be ruled out, according to experts.\n\nHere are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades:\n\n1)Key Levels For TheNifty 50(25,666)\n\nResistance based on pivot points: 25,759, 25,803, and 25,875\n\nSupport based on pivot points: 25,615, 25,571, and 25,499\n\nSpecial Formation: The Nifty 50 formed a small-bodied green candle with a long upper shadow on the daily charts, accompanied by above-average volumes, indicating selling pressure at higher levels amid range-bound trading. Additionally, there was a tweezer bottomâ€“like pattern formation (not a classical one), which is a bullish reversal pattern but requires confirmation in the following session. The index continued to trade below short- and medium-term moving averages, with the 10-day EMA remaining below the 20-day EMA, and it is on the verge of breaking down below the 50-day EMA. The RSI dropped to 39.26, while the MACD remained below the signal line, with further weakness visible in the histogram. All these indicators suggest continued weakness and caution for bulls.\n\n2)Key Levels For TheBank Nifty(59,580)\n\nResistance based on pivot points: 59,747, 59,859, and 60,039\n\nSupport based on pivot points: 59,387, 59,275, and 59,095\n\nResistance based on Fibonacci retracement: 59,839, 60,103\n\nSupport based on Fibonacci retracement: 59,080, 58,712\n\nSpecial Formation:The Bank Nifty closed flat and formed a bullish candle with an upper shadow on the daily charts, accompanied by above-average volumes, while sustaining above the 20-day EMA, the midline of the Bollinger Bands, and key support trendlines, indicating a positive bias despite pressure at higher levels. The index continued its higher highâ€“higher low formation for another session. The RSI inched up slightly to 53.55, though it remained below the reference line. The MACD continued below the signal line with further weakness in the histogram; however, the Stochastic RSI turned bullish. All these indicators point towards a cautiously positive bias for the Bank Nifty.\n\n3)Nifty Call Options Data\n\nAccording to the weekly options data, the maximum Call open interest was seen at the 26,000 strike (with 1.27 crore contracts). This level can act as a key resistance level for the Nifty in the short term. It was followed by the 25,800 strike (86.57 lakh contracts) and 26,500 strike (79.19 lakh contracts).\n\nMaximum Call writing was observed at the 26,000 strike, which saw an addition of 56.37 lakh contracts, followed by the 26,400 and 26,500 strikes, which added 36.04 lakh and 33.92 lakh contracts, respectively. There was hardly any Call unwinding seen in the 25,000-26,500 strike band.\n\n4)Nifty Put Options Data\n\nOn the Put side, the 25,000 strike holds the maximum Put open interest (with 77.05 lakh contracts), which can act as a key support level for the Nifty in the short term. It was followed by the 25,500 strike (47.86 lakh contracts) and the 25,600 strike (45.69 lakh contracts).\n\nThe maximum Put writing was placed at the 25,000 strike, which saw an addition of 37.34 lakh contracts, followed by the 25,600 and 25,300 strikes, which added 17.1 lakh and 16.27 lakh contracts, respectively. The maximum Put unwinding was seen at the 25,950 strike, which shed 66,560 contracts, followed by the 26,200 and 26,000 strikes, which shed 64,480 and 36,075 contracts, respectively.\n\n5)Bank Nifty Call Options Data\n\nAccording to the monthly options data, the maximum Call open interest was seen at the 59,500 strike, with 15.83 lakh contracts. This can act as a key level for the index in the short term. It was followed by the 60,000 strike (14.84 lakh contracts) and the 61,000 strike (7.99 lakh contracts).\n\nMaximum Call writing was observed at the 60,700 strike (with the addition of 1.6 lakh contracts), followed by the 60,100 strike (1.21 lakh contracts) and 61,000 strike (16,410 contracts). The maximum Call unwinding was seen at the 60,000 strike, which shed 1.06 lakh contracts, followed by the 59,500 and 59,000 strikes which shed 33,870 and 26,280 contracts, respectively.\n\n6)Bank Nifty Put Options Data\n\nOn the Put side, the 59,500 strike holds the maximum Put open interest (with 19.16 lakh contracts), which can act as a key support level for the index. This was followed by the 59,000 strike (9.84 lakh contracts) and the 60,000 strike (8.1 lakh contracts).\n\nThe maximum Put writing was placed at the 59,100 strike (which added 1.27 lakh contracts), followed by the 59,800 strike (87,270 contracts) and the 59,700 strike (56,550 contracts). The maximum Put unwinding was seen at the 58,000 strike, which shed 56,820 contracts, followed by the 59,200 and 59,000 strikes, which shed 28,080 and 23,670 contracts, respectively.\n\n7)Funds Flow (Rs crore)\n\nThe Nifty Put-Call ratio (PCR), which indicates the mood of the market, fell to 0.81 on January 14, compared to 0.86 in the previous session.\n\nThe increasing PCR, or being higher than 0.7 or surpassing 1, means traders are selling more Put options than Call options, which generally indicates the firming up of a bullish sentiment in the market. If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.\n\nThe fear gauge, India VIX, remained at elevated levels, holding above its 20-, 50-, and 100-day EMAs, and climbed near the 11.50 zone intraday before ending at 11.32, up 1.09 percent. This indicates continued caution for bulls until the VIX decisively falls below the 10 zone.\n\n10)Long Build-up (63 Stocks)\n\nA long build-up was seen in 63 stocks. An increase in open interest (OI) and price indicates a build-up of long positions.\n\n11)Long Unwinding (32 Stocks)\n\n32 stocks saw a decline in open interest (OI) along with a fall in price, indicating long unwinding.\n\n12)Short Build-up (71 Stocks)\n\n71 stocks saw an increase in OI along with a fall in price, indicating a build-up of short positions.\n\n13)Short-Covering (45 Stocks)\n\n45 stocks saw short-covering, meaning a decrease in OI, along with a price increase.\n\n14)High Delivery Trades\n\nHere are the stocks that saw a high share of delivery trades.

Services business performance was also strong (+1.8% QoQ CC) defying the furloughs and holidays impact. The service business growth was majorly led by ER&D segment that reported another quarter of strong growth (+3.1% QoQ CC vs 2.2% QoQ CC LQ). The service-led growth was largely aided by extop 20 accounts (+2.3% QoQ), which implies the decision making and execution cycle remains strong at the lower-end of the pyramid. Again, the advanced AI revenue growth (19.9% QoQ CC) is largely a component of short-burst deals that further validates the velocity of smaller deal remains strong. The new deal TCV reported at USD3.0b, which includes one of the mega deals (USD473m) of five-year strategic engagement. We believe the service-led growth should continue its momentum in FY27/FY28 on the back of strong order wins and growing AI revenue stream. Hence, we are revising the topline CC growth upward by 30bps/20bps to 7.0% and 7.7% for FY27E/FY28E.

{"title": "Creating a money file for your family is not morbid. It’s practical", "content": "Most people organise their money for themselves, not for the people who may need to step in one day. Passwords are remembered, not written down. Insurance details are “somewhere in email”. Nominees are assumed to be updated. Bank accounts are known only vaguely.\n\nThis works fine as long as nothing goes wrong. The moment something does, families are left guessing. Not just about money, but about where to even begin. A simple “money file” exists to prevent that confusion.\n\nWhat a money file is actually meant to do\n\nA money file is not a balance sheet and not a will. It’s a guide. It tells your family what exists, where it exists, and how to access information when you’re not around to explain it.\n\nThe aim is clarity, not control. You’re not handing over money. You’re handing over a map.\n\nPeople often imagine this as a complex exercise. It isn’t. It’s just writing things down in a way that someone else can understand without calling ten people.\n\nPasswords are the hardest, and the most sensitive part\n\nPasswords are where most people freeze. They worry about security, misuse, or things falling into the wrong hands. Those concerns are valid.\n\nThe mistake is thinking the choice is between secrecy and chaos.\n\nYou don’t need to write down every password in plain text. What you do need is a way for your family to know how access works. That could mean storing passwords in a reputable password manager and sharing how to access it. Or noting where digital access is stored, rather than the credentials themselves.\n\nWhat matters is that your family isn’t locked out of bank accounts, email, or investment platforms at the exact moment they need them most.\n\nNominees are not paperwork you can ignore\n\nMany people assume nominees are already in place. Often they aren’t. Or they were set years ago and never updated.\n\nA money file should clearly list every account and who the nominee is for each one. Bank accounts, mutual funds, DEMAT accounts, insurance policies, provident fund. All of them.\n\nThis matters because nominees are the first point of contact for institutions. Missing or outdated nominations don’t just slow things down. They create legal and administrative hurdles at an already stressful time.\n\nInsurance details need to be obvious, not buried\n\nInsurance is one of the most important parts of a money file, and also the most poorly organised.\n\nFamilies often know there is insurance, but not which company, what kind, or how to claim it. Policy documents are scattered across inboxes and apps.\n\nA good money file clearly states what insurance exists, where the policy is held, the policy number, and how claims are initiated. Health insurance, life insurance, accidental cover, everything.\n\nThe difference between knowing and not knowing this information can be the difference between timely support and months of delay.\n\nWhat to store digitally, and what to keep offline\n\nNot everything belongs in one place. Sensitive information like access instructions works best in a secure digital format that can be updated easily. But it should be backed by something physical that tells your family where to look.\n\nA simple offline note saying where digital records are stored, who to contact, and what to prioritise can be invaluable. It doesn’t need numbers or passwords. It needs direction.\n\nThe biggest mistake is storing everything only in your head.\n\nHow detailed this really needs to be\n\nThis doesn’t need to be perfect. It needs to be usable. Your family doesn’t need your entire financial philosophy. They need to know which accounts exist, which are active, which are long-term, and who can help if they’re stuck. That could be a trusted friend, a financial adviser, or even a specific bank relationship manager.\n\nThe file should be written for someone who doesn’t deal with money the way you do.\n\nWhy this is an act of care, not pessimism\n\nPeople avoid this exercise because it feels uncomfortable. As if preparing for uncertainty somehow invites it.\n\nIn reality, a money file is no different from writing down emergency contacts or medical history. It’s about reducing stress for people you care about.\n\nYou don’t create it because something will happen. You create it so that if it does, your family isn’t left guessing in the dark.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 17:01 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

This was a decline of 5 per cent from 2017, when the voter turnout was recorded at 61.60 per cent.\n\nMaharashtra Municipal Election Results Live Updates: Civic polls clouded by ink row\n\nAs voting commenced on Thursday morning, social media was flooded with videos of ordinary voters, politicians, and some mediapersons using Acetone to wipe off the ‘indelible’ ink on their fingers after voting. The State Election Commission, however, rejected the allegations and warned of acting against those propagating such claims.\n\nShiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray claimed irregularities in the civic polls, terming it an attempt to murder democracy, and urged voters to dislodge the “brutal, fraud, corrupt and dictatorial regime “ of the BJP. Raj Thackeray claimed that the State Election Commission is using a new pen, due to which the markings on the voter's fingers disappeared.\n\nAfter casting his vote in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) elections, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said, “I have also been marked with a marker, is it erasing? Creating a ruckus on everything and raising questions is wrong.” Ink applied to fingers with marker pens after casting vote in the municipal corporation elections can be removed easily and lead to bogus voting, Maharashtra minister Sanjay Shirsat said.\n\n\"It is true that the ink of marker pen is getting removed easily. There is a possibility of bogus voting at some places due to this. Polling agents and officials should pay strict attention to this,\" he told reporters.\n\nBMC Election Live Updates: Why did the BMC polls face significant delays?\n\nThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections faced significant delays due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Supreme Court rulings on OBC reservations and issues related to ward delimitation.\n\nThe last BMC polls were held in 2017. The term of the corporators ended on 7 March 2022, and subsequent elections could not be held in time, resulting in the civic body being placed under an administrator.\n\nMaharashtra elections Live: What was the voter turnout in 2017 elections?\n\nIn the 2017 elections, the polling percentage in Mumbai was 55.53, while the average voting figure in 26 corporations - elections were held for the first time in Jalna and Ichalkaranji municipal corporations – was 56.35 per cent.\n\nMaharashtra Municipal Election Results Live Updates: List of municipal corporations that went to polls on January 15\n\nThe municipal corporations that went to polls include Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Ulhasnagar, Kalyan-Dombivli, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Mira-Bhayandar, Vasai-Virar, Panvel, Nashik, Malegaon, Ahilyanagar, Jalgaon, Dhule, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Solapur, Kolhapur, Ichalkaranji, Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Nanded-Waghala, Parbhani, Jalna, Latur, Amravati, Akola, Nagpur and Chandrapur.\n\nMaharashtra Municipal Election Results Live: Exit polls predict sweep for BJP-led Mahayuti in Mumbai\n\nVoting took place on Thursday with Mumbai seeing a voter turnout of around 50 percent.

{"title": "OPINION | India’s growth is holding up, but with narrower foundations", "content": "India’s latest national accounts estimate project real GDP growth of 7.4 percent and nominal growth of around 8 percent in 2025–26. On the surface, these numbers reinforce India’s status as one of the fastest-growing major economies. Yet a closer look at the data reveals a more uneasy story about thequality, composition, and sustainabilityof this growth.\n\nA narrowing nominal–real gap\n\nOne of the most striking features of the latest projections is the unusually narrow gap between real and nominal GDP growth. Historically, India’s nominal growth has exceeded real growth by a wider margin (4-6%), reflecting moderate inflation and pricing power across sectors. The current compression suggests weak price momentum and emerging deflationary pressures.\n\nThis is not a benign development. In a developing economy, persistently low inflation can erode producer margins, discourage capacity expansion, and dampen private investment. For a country still attempting to build scale in manufacturing and absorb a large labour force, deflationary tendencies risk becoming a constraint rather than a comfort.\n\nWhere incremental growth is coming from\n\nIn nominal terms, gross value added (GVA) is expected to rise by ₹23.26 lakh crore between 2024–25 and 2025–26. What stands out is the sectoral concentration of this increase. Nearly three-fourths of incremental GVA, about ₹17.47 lakh crore, comes from the tertiary sector alone.\n\nWithin services, growth is powered by financial, real estate and professional services, which account for roughly one-third of the total increase, followed by public administration, defence and other services (25 percent) and trade, transport, hotels and communication services (16 percent). In contrast, the primary sector contributes less than one percent to incremental value addition, with agriculture contributing less than 2%. Manufacturing and construction account for about 16 percent and 7 percent respectively.\n\nWhat matters is not just where growth occurs, but how strongly it is linked to the rest of the economy. Much of India’s recent services-led expansion is concentrated in activities with weak backward linkages, financial services, real estate, and professional services rely relatively little on domestically produced intermediate inputs. As a result, growth impulses generated in these sectors are not transmitted effectively throughout the economy. Input–output studies for India show that once import intensity is accounted for, many high-growth service activities exhibit lower domestic multiplier effects than manufacturing or construction (Sharma, Padhi, & Rath, 2022). This helps explain why rapid GDP growth has coincided with modest job creation and stagnant incomes in sectors that employ the bulk of the workforce.\n\nWhat high-frequency indicators suggest\n\nHigh-frequency indicators (HFIs) are not designed to replicate national accounts estimates. However, when averaged over April to November, they provide a useful sense of the economy’s underlying momentum, and that momentum appears more moderate than headline GDP numbers suggest.\n\nOn the consumption side, IIP consumer durables grew by around 4 percent, while IIP consumer non-durables contracted by roughly 2 percent, pointing to uneven household demand. Fuel consumption has been subdued, with petrol rising about 6.3 percent and diesel just 2.8 percent, indicating limited industrial and freight intensity.\n\nInvestment indicators show steadiness rather than exuberance. Gross fixed capital formation rose by 8.3 percent, while IIP capital goods increased by about 7 percent. External trade has held up better than expected despite global fragmentation, with merchandise exports and imports growing by around 9–10 percent.\n\nAt the same time, IIP electricity contracted marginally, often a warning sign for broad-based industrial activity. Overall, high-frequency indicators suggest resilience but not exuberance. Although manufacturing and services PMIs have stayed above the expansion threshold of 50 since April, readings in the mid-50s to low-60s range indicate steady but moderate expansion, rather than a sharp acceleration in activity.\n\nA revealing divergence\n\nRead together, the divergence between headline GDP growth and high-frequency indicators is telling. Is this divergence incompatible? Or is India’s growth is being driven less by physical production and more by services, public spending, and service-sector value addition?\n\nThis divergence offers a clear signal that primary & secondary sectors are not driving India’s current growth phase. Instead, income gains are increasingly decoupled from sectors that employ the bulk of the workforce. The result is a widening productivity and income gap between services and the rest of the economy weakening the link between growth, job creation, and broad-based demand.\n\nIndia’s growth story remains credible, but its foundations are becoming narrower. As services take the lead and manufacturing struggles to assume a central role, growth risks becoming less inclusive and more spatially and socially uneven. Sustaining high growth while generating jobs and raising incomes across sectors will require more than strong headline numbers, it will require re-anchoring growth in sectors that combine productivity gains with large-scale employment.\n\nWithout that shift, India may continue to grow fast, but the disconnect between growth and livelihoods will only widen.\n\n(Dr Rajiv Kumar, Chairperson, Pahlé India Foundation and former Vice Chairman NITI Aayog and Samriddhi Prakash, Research Associate, Pahlé India Foundation.)\n\nViews are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.", "company": "", "date": "January 16, 2026/ 21:30 IST", "category": "opinion", "author": "Rajiv Kumar&\n                                                                                                               Samriddhi Prakash"}
{"title": "Banking complaints? RBI's integrated ombudsman scheme 2026 is here to help", "content": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has introduced the Integrated Ombudsman Scheme, 2026, to make it easier for customers to resolve complaints against banks and other financial institutions.\n\nThis scheme, effective from July 1, 2026, replaces the 2021 version and aims to provide a quick and fair way to handle grievances without going to court.\n\nLet's break down the key points from the Integrated Ombudsman Scheme, 2026.\n\nWhat is the scheme and its purpose?\n\nThe RBI Integrated Ombudsman Scheme is designed to fix problems related to poor service from financial entities regulated by the RBI. The scheme covers issues like delays in services, unfair charges, or mishandling of accounts.\n\nIt starts on July 1, 2026, and applies across India. The goal is to resolve complaints quickly without legal battles.\n\nFor any consequential loss suffered by the Complainant, the RBI Ombudsman shall have the power to provide a compensation up to Rs 30 lakh. In addition, the RBI Ombudsman shall also have the power to provide a compensation up to Rs 3 lakh for the loss of the complainant’s time, expenses incurred, harassment/mental anguish suffered, etc., if any, by the complainant.\n\nThere's no limit on the dispute amount, but compensation for losses is capped at Rs 30 lakh, plus up to Rs 3 lakh for stress or expenses.\n\nAlso read |Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card vs Flipkart SBI Credit Card: Which one delivers better value?\n\nThe entities covered under this include commercial banks, regional rural banks, state and central co-operative banks, and urban co-operative banks with deposits of Rs 50 crore or more.\n\nAdditionally, Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) that accept deposits or have assets over Rs 100 crore and engage in customer dealings are also included, excluding housing finance and core investment companies.\n\nFurthermore, all non-bank prepaid payment issuers, such as digital wallets, and credit information companies that handle credit scores, are part of this list.\n\nBanks or NBFCs in trouble (like under resolution or RBI restrictions) are excluded.\n\nHow to File a Complaint?\n\nFirst rule: You must complain to the entity (e.g., your bank) in writing or any mode, and give them time to respond—usually 30 days, or longer if RBI rules specify. If no reply or you're unhappy, file with the RBI Ombudsman within 90 days of that deadline.\n\nSteps to file a complaint:\n\n- Online via the CMS portal (cms.rbi.org.in).\n\n- Email to crpc@rbi.org.in.\n\n- Post to the Centralised Receipt and Processing Centre (CRPC) in Chandigarh.\n\nUse the provided form in the annex, including your details, complaint proof, and what relief you want.\n\nComplaints must be genuine—not abusive or old (beyond the Limitation Act, 1963). Some complaints are invalid from the start, like those already in court, commercial decisions, or vendor disputes.\n\nAlso read |Why old tax regime still works for some taxpayers\n\nThe complaint handling process\n\nOnce filed, the CRPC checks if it's valid. Then, it's sent to an RBI Ombudsman office. The entity gets 15 days to respond with documents.\n\nThe process is informal—no strict evidence rules. The Ombudsman tries to settle via mediation, like advising the entity to fix the issue or holding a meeting (in-person or online). If settled, the complaint closes. If not, the Ombudsman can issue a decision after hearing both sides.\n\nComplaints can be rejected if frivolous, lacking merit, or needing complex evidence.\n\nPowers of the Ombudsman\n\nThe RBI Ombudsman (or Deputy) acts like a judge for these disputes. They consider RBI guidelines and fair practices. They can add other entities to the case if involved in the problem.\n\nThe key powers include facilitating settlements, awarding compensation up to specified caps, quickly closing simple cases, and publishing reports in the public interest.\n\nDeputies handle basic closures, while full Ombudsmen deal with complex ones.\n\nAppeals and final steps\n\nUnhappy with the decision, then customer can appeal to the Appellate Authority (RBI's Executive Director) within 30 days. Entities can appeal too, but only with senior approval and not if they ignored document requests.\n\nThe Authority can uphold, change, or send back the case. Regulated entities must display scheme details in branches and websites, appoint a nodal officer, and comply fully—or face RBI action.\n\nWhy this matters for customers?\n\nThis scheme empowers everyday customers by offering a hassle-free alternative to lawsuits. It repeals the old 2021 scheme but handles pending cases under the prior rules.\n\nIf issues arise in implementation, RBI can tweak it. Overall, it's a step toward better consumer protection in finance—think of it as your safety net for banking woes.", "company": "", "date": "January 16, 2026/ 18:35 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Hiral Thanawala"}

The company is positioning Cognilix as a software layer that works alongside existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, rather than as a standalone software-as-a-service (SaaS) pivot.\n\nWhat is Cognilix built on?Cognilix is built on Moglix’s operating footprint of more than $40 billion in procurement transactions, over 45,000 suppliers, 1.2 million stock keeping units (SKUs), operations across more than 80 countries and a network of 58 warehouses.\n\n“About 50–60 percent of the value had to be built inside Moglix first,” founder and chief executive Rahul Garg told Moneycontrol. “We are now externalising it because procurement globally still uses very little technology, and most software products don’t reflect how procurement teams actually work.”\n\nWhat does Cognilix do for enterprises?The platform enables enterprises to automate procurement workflows such as digital catalogues, request-for-quotation (RFQ) comparisons, supplier onboarding, compliance checks, competitive electronic auctions and inventory forecasting based on historical usage.It also supports structured B2B selling through digital storefronts with integrated order management, payments, logistics and real-time inventory visibility, while standardising enterprise data across procurement and supply chains.\n\nWho is already using Cognilix, and what are they seeing?According to Garg, more than 10 large enterprises are already using Cognilix as a standalone platform, while over 1,000 customers use one or more of its underlying modules through the broader Moglix ecosystem.Garg said early use cases include inventory reductions of up to 30% for some enterprises, as well as improvements in sales efficiency and total cost of ownership for large manufacturing customers.\n\nHow will Moglix make money from Cognilix?Cognilix will be offered as a white-labelled software stack and monetised primarily through software fees, with some customers opting for pricing linked to commerce volumes.\n\nWhat does this mean for Moglix’s broader business?The launch comes as Moglix sharpens its focus on improving operating leverage. In the financial year ended March 2025 (FY25), the company reported a 15 percent increase in revenue to around $700 million and nearly halved its losses. While Moglix has previously indicated interest in a public listing around 2027, Garg said discussions on timing remain premature as the company works through structural issues such as redomiciling from Singapore to India.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 15:58 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Aryaman Gupta"}

{"title": "EPF withdrawals are finally getting easier. Here’s what changed in 2026 and why it matters", "content": "If you have ever tried to withdraw money from your EPF account, you probably remember the feeling. You filled the form. You waited. Then you waited some more. And after a few weeks, you discovered your claim had been rejected because your name had one extra initial or your bank account wasn’t “properly mapped”.\n\nFor a long time, the EPF system wasn’t just slow. It was unpredictable. Two people with identical situations could get completely different outcomes.\n\nThat experience is beginning to change in 2026.\n\nWithout much fanfare, the EPFO has fixed some of the plumbing behind the scenes. The result is that online withdrawals are now noticeably smoother for a large number of employees.\n\nWhat is actually different now\n\nThe biggest difference is that the system now checks your details before it accepts your claim, not weeks later.\n\nIf your Aadhaar name doesn’t match your EPF record, or your bank account is not verified, the portal now tells you immediately. Earlier, you would find this out only after your claim had sat in limbo.\n\nThere is also much better coordination between Aadhaar, PAN, bank databases and EPFO records. If your KYC is already clean and consistent, the claim often moves without any human intervention at all.\n\nMany partial withdrawal claims are now getting auto-settled. In plain English, that means no clerk needs to approve them manually. If you’re eligible and your documents are in order, the system clears it on its own, often in a few working days.\n\nThe rules haven’t changed much, the experience has\n\nYou still cannot treat EPF like a savings account. The old rules remain.\n\nIf you’ve been unemployed for a month, you can take out up to 75 percent of your balance. After two months, you can withdraw the full amount. Partial withdrawals are allowed for things like medical treatment, buying or building a house, education or marriage.\n\nWhat has changed is how reliably these requests now move through the system.\n\nEarlier, even a legitimate claim could get stuck for no obvious reason. Now, if something is wrong, you usually know right away.\n\nWhy people are still getting rejected\n\nDespite all the improvements, rejections haven’t disappeared.\n\nMost of them still happen for boring reasons: name mismatches, inactive bank accounts, missing PAN details, or old employer records that were never cleaned up.\n\nMany people assume that updating KYC in one place fixes everything. It doesn’t. If your Aadhaar says one thing, your bank says another and EPFO says a third, the system simply refuses to move.\n\nThe difference is that it now refuses quickly instead of wasting your time first.\n\nEPF is quietly becoming more usable\n\nThere’s a subtle shift happening because of all this. People are starting to see EPF not just as locked-up retirement money, but also as a backup cushion in genuine emergencies. When withdrawals become predictable and reasonably fast, behaviour changes.\n\nThat doesn’t mean it’s a good idea to dip into it casually. Every early withdrawal hurts long-term compounding. But in a medical emergency or a sudden job loss, knowing the money is actually accessible is a real comfort.\n\nThe one thing you should do before you ever need the money\n\nDon’t wait for a crisis to discover your records are a mess.\n\nLog into the EPFO portal once. Check whether Aadhaar, PAN and bank account are all showing as verified. Check whether your name and date of birth look the same everywhere. Make sure your UAN is linked to your current phone number.\n\nThis is boring work. But in 2026, this boring work is the difference between getting your money in a week and spending three months chasing helpdesks.\n\nThe system is better. It’s also stricter.\n\nEPFO’s digital overhaul is a genuine improvement. It is faster, more logical and far less arbitrary than it used to be. But it is also less forgiving. If your data is clean, things work. If it isn’t, the system won’t bend.\n\nFor the first time in years, EPF withdrawals feel less like a gamble and more like a proper financial service. And that, by itself, is a quiet but important change.\n\n1. Can I withdraw EPF even if my employer has not approved or updated something?\n\nIn most straightforward cases, yes. If your Aadhaar, PAN and bank account are already verified and your UAN is active, many claims now get processed automatically without employer intervention. However, if your KYC is incomplete or your employment records are outdated, the claim can still get stuck and may require employer action.\n\n2. How long does an online EPF withdrawal usually take in 2026?\n\nIf everything is in order, many claims are now being settled within a few working days, sometimes even faster. There is no guaranteed timeline, but delays of several weeks are becoming less common for clean, fully verified accounts.\n\n3. Will withdrawing EPF early affect my taxes or future retirement savings?\n\nYes. If you withdraw before completing five years of continuous service, the amount can be taxable in certain cases. More importantly, every early withdrawal reduces the power of long-term compounding. It’s best treated as an emergency back-up, not a regular source of funds.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 15:31 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

People are willing to stay invested for the long term, but they seek clarity. That is why, going into Budget 2026, we expect meaningful direction on capital gains and holding periods.\n\nInvestors today build portfolios across equities, debt and alternative assets with horizons that stretch well beyond market cycles. When holding periods differ widely across instruments, tax considerations begin to influence decisions more than fundamentals. What markets are looking for is a framework that is easy to understand and consistent enough to plan around. Clarity creates confidence. When investors know what qualifies as long term ownership, they are far more comfortable committing capital patiently. This reduces short term churn and supports healthier market behaviour. It also aligns investor outcomes with the broader objective of capital formation. We do not see this as a question of lowering taxes. Rather, it is about drawing a clear line between investing and speculation. Simple and predictable rules can discourage excesses without penalising investors who are participating responsibly in India’s growth.\n\nFrom a wealth management perspective, clear capital gains treatment allows us to channel conversations to where they belong. Asset allocation, risk management and long term goals should drive portfolios, not uncertainty around taxation. India has taken important steps in bringing household savings into financial markets. The next phase is about strengthening trust and staying power. A simplified and predictable approach to capital gains in Budget 2026 would be a strong signal that long term investors remain at the centre of policy thinking. -- Harsha Vardhana, Founder & Group CEO, Atom Financial Services:\n\nBudget 2026 Expectations Live: 'Regulatory clarity around data usage, AI accountability, and sector-specific compliance frameworks is essential'\n\nAs AI becomes core infrastructure for enterprises, the Union Budget 2026 must focus on accelerating deployment rather than just enabling access. Reducing friction in scaling AI will require sustained investment in digital infrastructure, targeted incentives for deep tech R&D, and skilling initiatives aligned with applied AI roles. At the same time, regulatory clarity around data usage, AI accountability, and sector-specific compliance frameworks is essential, particularly for regulated industries such as BFSI and healthcare. Predictable and practical regulations can help enterprises adopt AI with confidence and responsibility. From an industry standpoint, measures that improve ease of doing business, rationalise compliance overheads, and support MSMEs in adopting advanced technologies can meaningfully unlock the next phase of growth. -- Apurv Agrawal, Co-Founder & CEO, Squadstack.ai\n\nBudget 2026 Expectations Live: High cost of Artificial Intelligence integration must be addressed’\n\nThe landmark GST 2.0 reforms implemented in September 2025 have provided a significant fillip to the healthcare industry. The reduction in GST rates from 12% to 5% on ophthalmic equipment is a visionary step that directly supports ASG Eye Hospital's \"Vision 2030\" to democratize affordable and accessible eye care pan-India. By lowering the tax barrier on essential medical technology, the government has set the stage for a more inclusive healthcare ecosystem where advanced treatments are no longer a luxury but a standard of care.\n\nTo further this momentum, we urge the government to address the structural challenge of \"embedded taxes\" that continue to inflate operational costs. Since clinical services currently remain in the \"exempt\" category, hospitals are unable to avail Input Tax Credit (ITC) on their procurement of equipment and services. Granting \"zero-rated\" status to healthcare or introducing a minimal GST slab with full ITC eligibility would unlock an estimated 5–6% of costs currently trapped within the supply chain. This structural shift would allow hospitals to pass on substantial direct savings to patients, truly maximizing the impact of the recent rate rationalizations.\n\nIn addition to GST reforms, the government could significantly lower the cost of technology adoption by doing away with the residual 7.5%–10% Basic Customs Duty and the 5% Health Cess on high-precision, non-indigenous technologies. Equipment such as Femtosecond lasers and advanced retinal imaging systems are critical for sight-saving procedures but remain expensive to import. Eliminating these landed costs will facilitate deeper penetration into Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, ensuring that patients in smaller towns have access to the same world-class surgical offerings as those in metropolitan hubs.\n\nFurthermore, as we move toward a tech-led healthcare future, the high cost of Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration must be addressed. While AI-driven diagnostics for conditions like Diabetic Retinopathy can revolutionize early detection, the recurring costs of high-end software licenses, GPU-based computing power, and AI-integrated hardware remain prohibitive. We propose a weighted tax deduction on AI-related capital expenditure and a reduction in duties for diagnostic machines with embedded AI software. This would incentivize hospitals to deploy automated screening tools in remote areas, significantly reducing the burden of avoidable blindness through technology. Interest subsidies for medical centres branching out in under developed areas will incentivise them to adopt a pan India approach. These measures along with expanding the scope of the current PLI scheme to encourage made in India incentive for manufacturing of medical eye equipment will set the country on course to world class medical facilities. -- Arun Singhvi, MD & CEO, ASG Eye Hospital\n\nBudget 2026 Expectations Live: Continued emphasis on farm incomes, agri-infrastructure and consumption support will be vital to strengthen growth’\n\n“Budget 2026 comes at a crucial juncture for India’s consumption-led sectors, particularly FMCG and food staples, which sit at the intersection of household spending, farmer livelihoods and food security. Over the past year, policy stability and calibrated fiscal measures have helped sustain demand without adding inflationary pressure. With rural markets showing steady recovery, continued emphasis on farm incomes, agri-infrastructure and consumption support will be vital to strengthen growth at the base of the economy.\n\nFrom an agri value-chain perspective, policy support for domestic edible oilseed cultivation, such as mustard and soybean, can significantly reduce India’s edible oil import dependence and advance Aatmanirbhar Bharat. At AWL Agri Business Limited, we’ve already been working towards this goal through farmer partnerships, mustard-led model farm initiatives and integrated procurement-to-processing supply chains. Our digitisation, infrastructure development and sustainable sourcing are helping to improve productivity, assure farmer demand and enhance resilience across the value chain. A clear and predictable policy environment will further enable the industry to scale responsibly, invest with confidence and contribute meaningfully to inclusive self-reliant growth.” -- Angshu Mallick, Executive Deputy Chairman, AWL Agri Business Ltd\n\nBudget 2026 Expectations Live: Experts seek tax stability and simpler compliance in upcoming Union Budget\n\nTax and industry experts are calling for stability in tax rates, rationalisation of withholding taxes, faster dispute resolution, easier compliance norms for foreign companies and simpler taxation of employee stock options in the forthcoming Union Budget.\n\nRationalisation of tax deducted at source (TDS) has emerged as a key demand across sectors. Under the current framework, tax is deducted on specified payments such as salaries, interest, commission, rent and even cryptocurrency transactions beyond prescribed thresholds, with rates ranging from 0.1 per cent to 30 per cent. Experts say this complex structure has led to frequent disputes and litigation.\n\nBudget 2026: Markets eye 8-10% defence outlay hike but seek execution momentum, not just allocations\n\n“The market expects improved visibility for the defence sector, with incremental allocations largely directed towards drones, arms and ammunition, defence electronics and indigenisation,” according to, Ankit Soni, AVP Fundamental Research, Mirae Asset ShareKhan. Markets expect the defence budget to rise 8-10%, with any increase beyond 10% seen as a positive surprise. Allocations are likely to favour drones, arms and ammunition, and defence electronics, reflecting operational priorities and indigenisation efforts.

He added that statistics show taxpayers increasingly prefer the simpler approach under the new regime, without combining tax planning with investment decisions.\n\nBudget 2026 Expectations Live: Experts highlight long-term savings benefits\n\nExperts note that the old tax regime continues to encourage long-term savings, which remain essential. Amit Maheshwari, Managing Partner at AKM Global, said, \"While the new regime offers simplicity, transparency, and minimal documentation, abolishing the old regime could raise concerns. The old regime fosters financial discipline through investments in PPF, ELSS, insurance, and home loans, and supports protections such as mediclaim and other social security-linked deductions. A full transition to the new regime without these incentives may gradually discourage tax-linked savings and personal risk mitigation.\"\n\nBudget 2026 Expectations Live: Shift supported by recent Union Budget measures\n\nOfficial data shows that of the 7.28 crore ITRs filed for AY 2024-25 by July 31, 2024, 5.27 crore (72%) were under the new tax regime. The adoption likely increased after the Union Budget 2025-26 introduced more benefits and extended tax exemption up to Rs 12 lakh, up from the previous Rs 7 lakh limit. The Budget also revised income tax slabs, placing the 30% rate on incomes above Rs 24 lakh per year.\n\nBudget 2026 Expectations Live: Old regime may continue for select taxpayers\n\nAnother source noted that the old regime could continue and gradually phase out as fewer taxpayers use it. \"The old tax regime remains advantageous for those with long-term investments, savings, or home loans,\" the source added.\n\nBudget 2026 Expectations Live: Majority of taxpayers have shifted\n\n\"A large number of taxpayers have moved to the new income tax regime over the years, which offers several advantages. Roughly 80% of taxpayers are now in the new regime,\" said a source familiar with the matter. The Budget may indicate a sunset date for the old regime, though an immediate discontinuation is considered unlikely.\n\nBudget 2026 Expectations Live: New income tax regime gains popularity\n\nGood morning and welcome to Moneycontrol. As the buzz grows around the Union Budget presentation this year, there is a lot of discussion around one of the most imporatnt aspect of budget - personal tax.

The real gap lies in securing large enterprise customers, particularly outside India.\n\n\"There is a full gap between 'I have a great product' and actually selling it to global enterprises,\" Rao said, while terming it as a \"commercial chasm\" that determines whether startups can scale and raise follow-on funding rounds.\n\nThe market access programme will focus on building enabling startups with enterprise sales capabilities, boosting trust, security and reliability for global market and providing startups access to CXO-level networks, she said.\n\n“This is not just an advisory programme. We think of it as taking startups on a journey to get them a seat at the table, have a conversation, make a pitch and potentially get to contract,\" she said.\n\nRao said Indian startups building for India are often \"global ready\" from a product standpoint, given the complexity and diversity of the domestic market.

Urban areas, by contrast, saw a rise in joblessness, with the unemployment rate climbing to 6.7 percent in December from 6.5 percent a month earlier. This increase in cities was the primary driver of the overall rise in unemployment.\n\nFemale participation continued to be a bright spot.

{"title": "Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | The real job", "content": "In a little more than a fortnight, the central government will present its plan to earn and spend in the new fiscal year, along with an assessment of how it fared in the current fiscal year. The Union Budget determines which sectors get the big bucks, whether citizens get to keep more money in their wallets, how much will they need to give the state to supply them with what they need and who or what gets the short end of the money stick.\n\nAt the crux of this yearly financial circus is the important consideration of keeping the youth of the country gainfully employed that enables them to earn income and live their lives. Simply put, it is jobs. The single most important element that sways the pendulum of success politically and economically is how many jobs the administration of the day has created.\n\nIndia’s success on employment has been notably defensive. We have been able to reduce unemployment -- as the official figures say -- and even been somewhat successful in reducing the impact of external shocks such as the pandemic on the population’s earning capacity, but we haven’t been yet able to create a sustained high employment rate that takes us on the fast track to be a developed nation. Worryingly, we seem to be losing the plot of creating a relevantly skilled workforce. The National Skills mission still struggles to bridge the gap between demand for skilled workers and supply.\n\nNow, the government has enraged a part of the citizenry by changing the contours of its flagship employment guarantee scheme. The original two-decade old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA) was incidentally a big reason behind reducing the hardship of getting a job during the pandemic year. Under this scheme, rural folks were guaranteed 100 days of employment in a year at a fixed wage. The government claims that under the revamped scheme, 125 days of employment would be available, which shouldn’t irk anyone.\n\nBut the real deal breaker is that a large burden of the funding will now be on states, and as ourBudget Snapshot details here, state finances are not exactly healthy. Economists fear that the constraints of funding at state level would risk diluting the benefits of the scheme to a vast swathe of the population that depends on it. Notable economists such as Joseph Stiglitz and Thomas Piketty have criticised the changes.\n\nGiven the risks pointed out by economists, the new scheme may push many out of the guaranteed employment fold which may dent the rural consumption recovery that has spearheaded the improvement in consumption demand growth this year. Indeed, rural India has been a saviour when it comes to consuming more by having greater disposable income.\n\nWhat’s more, rural India’s employment rate remained stable in December in contrast to a softening in urban employment. Manas Chakravartydigs into the Periodic Labour Force Survey hereto find that rural employment has improved in the past three months and along with an increase in labour force participation rate, that augurs well for consumption.\n\nBut urban employment points to a near-term softening of household incomes and consumption. Shouldn’t the government refrain from complicating the consumption curve and instead boost employment?\n\nWhile the revamped MGNREGA will mean that 40 percent of the cost is borne by states (and hence risk crimping the availability of employment), the impact of the changes needs to be monitored in rural India in the coming year. Perhaps, the Budget should address the risks and offer a remedy for the same.\n\nElsewhere, the battle for better employment benefits for gig workers is on. Quick commerce companies have come under fire and have rolled back promises such as 10-minute delivery that puts their workers at risk. The Budget last year focused on formal recognition of gig workers and better healthcare. The government needs to take this forward in the upcoming Budget and perhaps increase the odds of gig workers getting employment benefits that formal work gets.\n\nAbove all, the government has the enviable job to reduce income inequality and make policies that reduce the lopsided contribution of sectors to economic growth and employment. We pointedhere a month agoout that half of the economic growth is from sectors that barely employ one-eighth of the workforce. The remedy could be in the Budget whereby the government can provide encouragement through incentives to boost the contribution of labour-intensive sectors in growth.\n\nThe government holds the power and the purse strings to boost employment, and this is perhaps the real job of the Budget.\n\nInvesting insights from our research team\n\nWeekly Tactical Pick: Why this midcap IT player merits a look\n\nInfosys Q3 FY26 – time to reverse the underperformance\n\nLTTS Q3 FY26: Deal momentum remains stable, visibility improves\n\nLemon Tree Hotels: Will the re-organisation unlock value for investors?\n\nCan the Union Budget lift sentiment for rural India?\n\n360 ONE Wealth: Solid Q3 earnings and upbeat guidance, a steady compounder\n\nMIDHANI: A beneficiary of the ongoing focus on defence\n\nWhat else are we reading?\n\nLabour codes cast accounting shadow on earnings\n\nBudget Snapshot: Fiscal goals need the hand of the states\n\nBudget 2026: Fixing the loose connections in India’s clean power circuit\n\nData Story | December data show rural jobs hold firm as urban labour market cools\n\nThe Union Budget must focus on national security\n\nVoltas and Blue Star – Left out in the cold?\n\nIndia’s quick commerce sector has boomed without help – but it’s time for sensible intervention\n\nFor fixed income investors, the forex market matters more now than the Budget does\n\nFiscal threats lurk in the undergrowth for Japan(republished from the FT)\n\nBudget 2026 and the expectations of emerging sectors\n\nThe scale of borrowing expected in the Budget may keep yields sticky\n\nDr Hedgewar’s final message and his lasting vision for the RSS\n\nIndia-Germany defence ties are on the cusp of a structural upgrade\n\nWhen Supreme Court leaves key issues unresolved, executive has the space to be arbitrary\n\nWhy young urban Indians are walking away from health insurance\n\nTax boost in Budget 2026 could ease India's housing paradox\n\nTechnical Picks: Reliance Industries, Tata Steel, Samvardhana Motherson, Paytm, Bank of India\n\nWe have a crack team of reporters writing on everything startups and tech.

The use of expert judgment is limited to “extraordinary circumstances (such as a fundamental shift in the economic or regulatory structure of the underlying market).” This implies a preference for markets where benchmark calculation does not require frequent intervention or adjustment.\n\nOperational continuity\n\nThe handbook says BISL may use expert judgment or discretion in certain limited circumstances, with regards to the extraordinary circumstances (such as a fundamental shift in the economic or regulatory structure of the underlying market), during a market emergency, a market disruption event, data disruption event and operational disruption event.\n\nThese provisions underscore Bloomberg’s focus on benchmarks that can be maintained consistently, without disruption across market conditions.\n\nBloomberg’s documentation indicates that inclusion in the Global Aggregate Bond Index is determined by alignment with its benchmark design principles rather than by the size of the economy, reform intent or discretionary assessment.\n\nTo qualify for inclusion, a market must consistently meet Bloomberg’s requirements for replicability, operational stability and transparency.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 15:42 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Manish M.

{"title": "Pitch report: Market players hope for lower STT, LTCG in Budget 2026", "content": "While the markets have seen sharp swings over the past financial year, from falling deep into the correction zone to notching record highs, investors' wishes from the Union Budget have remained the same. Most market participants wish for the lowering of the securities transaction tax (STT) and short-term capital gains tax (STCG), while many advocate for the removal of LTCG, or long-term capital gains tax, entirely.\n\nIn 2024, the STT was hiked sharply during the Union Budget, with the STT on an option increased to 0.1 percent of the option premium, up from 0.0625 percent. The securities transaction tax on the sale of a futures contract rose to 0.02 percent from 0.0125 percent of the price.\n\nSome have pitched for the removal of STT in the cash markets entirely. The tax levied on the buy and sell side of an equity delivery transaction amounts to 0.1 percent, which translates to Rs 100 per Rs 1,00,000.\n\nFurther, in 2024, the rate of the long-term capital gains tax was increased to 12.5 percent, up from 10 percent, while STCG was hiked to 20 percent from 15 percent earlier. Brokers, investors, AMCs, and market participants have lamented the higher taxes, stating that they discourage long-term investment. Further, in a financial year marked by volatility, market experts bemoaned the high taxes chipping away at the little gains made.\n\nVanita Salian Bangera, Head Institutional Sales Trading, Aikyam Capital Group, noted that India’s domestic equity ecosystem has structurally strengthened, with average monthly SIP inflows now doubled to Rs 28,202 crore in FY26 from Rs 13,000 crore in FY23, reflecting that retail investors are a stabilising counterbalance during periods of global volatility.\n\n“In this context, a calibrated rationalisation of LTCG would serve less as a tax concession and more as a behavioural incentive for long-term capital formation. Even marginal improvements in post-tax returns compound meaningfully over long holding periods, reinforcing household participation in financial assets,” added Bangera.\n\nWriting on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, market expert Safir Anand wrote that by scrapping LTCG, the markets could outperform, leading to higher collections in STT and STCG. Further, this is turn, would bring back foreign institutional investors. \"Most funds are struggling to beat [the market] and hence currently savings are being eroded,\" added Anand.\n\nHowever, some believe that no changes to the tax rates will be made. “On the tax front, I do not expect major changes in direct or indirect taxes, other than clarifications, since both regimes have undergone significant reform over the last 12 months,” said Saurav Ghosh, co-founder of Jiraaf.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

{"title": "Paid extra while buying a car? That TCS isn’t lost — here’s how you get it back", "content": "If you’ve bought a car priced above Rs 10 lakh in recent years, you may remember the final bill being slightly higher than expected. The dealer would have added 1 percent under something called TCS — tax collected at source. For most buyers, it feels like an extra tax on an already expensive purchase.\n\nBut that 1 percent is not really a “cost” in the way GST or registration charges are. In most cases, it’s just your own money that you’ve paid to the government a little early — and you can get it back.\n\nTCS on car purchases was introduced to help the tax department keep an eye on big-ticket spending. Any car with an ex-showroom price above Rs 10 lakh attracts a 1 percent TCS, which the dealer collects and deposits against your PAN. From your point of view, it looks like you paid more than the sticker price. In reality, you’ve simply prepaid a small part of your tax.\n\nWhy you are not actually losing this money\n\nTCS is not an extra tax in the true sense. It shows up in your Form 26AS and AIS as tax already paid on your behalf. When you file your income tax return, this amount is adjusted against your final tax liability.\n\nIf your total tax for the year is more than what has already been deducted or collected (through TDS and TCS), this amount just reduces what you still have to pay. But if your salary TDS and other deductions have already covered your tax, this TCS turns into a refund.\n\nThis is why many salaried buyers quietly get the full TCS amount back after filing their return — without really noticing where it came from.\n\nWhen does the money actually come back?\n\nThere is no separate “TCS refund” form or process. Everything happens automatically when you file your income tax return.\n\nOnce your return is processed, the system looks at your total tax liability and compares it with all the tax already paid on your behalf. If you’ve paid more than required, the excess — including the TCS on your car — is sent back to your bank account.\n\nIn most cases, refunds come within a few weeks or a couple of months, depending on how early you file and whether the return is picked up for checks.\n\nOne thing you must check before filing\n\nBefore you file your return, log into the income tax portal and check your AIS or Form 26AS.\n\nYou should see an entry from the car dealer showing the TCS collected against your PAN. If it’s there, you don’t need to do anything special — just file your return normally and the credit will be adjusted automatically.\n\nIf it’s missing, contact the dealer immediately. This usually happens because the PAN was entered incorrectly or the dealer hasn’t filed the TCS return properly. If the entry doesn’t show\n\nup in your tax records, the tax department will not give you credit for it — even if you actually paid the money.\n\nA very common misunderstanding\n\nMany buyers assume TCS is like GST — once paid, it’s gone forever. That’s not true. It’s closer to TDS from your salary. It’s simply tax paid in advance. Whether you “lose” it or get it back depends entirely on your overall tax situation for the year.\n\nIf you’re already paying enough tax through salary deductions, this extra 1% usually comes back as a refund. If you still owe tax, it just reduces your final bill.\n\nIf your income or tax liability is low\n\nThis is where TCS matters the most. If your taxable income is low or deductions wipe out most of your tax, the entire TCS amount can come back as a refund. But only if you file your return. Even people who normally don’t need to file a return should do so if they want this money back.\n\nWhy the government does this in the first place\n\nThe real goal of TCS is not to collect more tax. It’s to create a spending trail. High-value purchases like cars, jewellery and foreign travel help the tax department match lifestyle spending with declared income. From your side, it’s mostly a timing issue — you pay a bit early and settle it later.\n\nIf you paid TCS on a car, don’t write that money off mentally. Check that it shows up in your tax records. File your return properly. And if your taxes are already covered, that extra 1% will quietly come back to your bank account.\n\n1. Is TCS on a car purchase always refundable?\n\nNot automatically. It is adjusted against your final tax bill. If your total tax payable is less than the tax already deducted and collected, the extra amount is refunded.\n\n2. What if I don’t file an income tax return?\n\nYou won’t get the TCS back. Filing a return is the only way to claim this amount.\n\n3. What if the TCS does not appear in Form 26AS or AIS?\n\nContact the dealer and ask them to correct the filing. Until it reflects in your tax records, you won’t get credit for it.\n\n4. How long does a refund usually take?\n\nIf there are no issues, it usually comes within a few weeks to a couple of months after the return is processed. Delays can happen if there are mismatches or verification checks.", "company": "", "date": "January 12, 2026/ 19:00 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

{"title": "Govt considering chain-linking of IIP to keep with global standards", "content": "India may soon overhaul the way it measures industrial activity, with the government considering a shift in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) from a fixed-base system to a chain-linked methodology. The move would align India’s industrial statistics more closely with global practices, but it would also introduce more frequent revisions to the data.\n\nAt present, the IIP series uses 2011–12 as its base year, with sectoral and industry weights remaining unchanged until a formal rebasing exercise is carried out—often after a long gap. While this approach offers stability and ease of interpretation, it risks becoming less representative as the structure of industry evolves over time.\n\nIn a discussion paper released for stakeholder consultation, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation has outlined the feasibility of adopting a chain-based IIP. Under such a framework, the effective base year would be updated every year. Instead of comparing current output to a single reference year fixed far in the past, a chain-linked index measures changes relative to the immediately preceding year, using more recent weights that better reflect the current industrial landscape.\n\nMoneycontrolhad earlier reported that the government was examining a move towards chain-based indices as part of a broader effort to bring India’s statistical system in line with international norms. Many advanced economies already rely on chain-linking for key macroeconomic indicators to better capture structural shifts in production and consumption.\n\nThe discussion paper sets out three possible techniques to implement chain-linking for a high-frequency indicator like the monthly IIP: the annual overlap method, the one-month overlap method and the over-the-year method. Each approach differs in how successive series are linked and how continuity is maintained when weights are updated.\n\nThe proposed shift, however, comes with trade-offs. One key limitation of chain-linked indices is the loss of additivity—lower-level industry indices will no longer sum exactly to higher-level aggregates, making the data less intuitive for some users. More importantly, the new system would involve multiple revisions to IIP numbers over a two-year period, as more complete information from the national accounts and the Annual Survey of Industries becomes available.", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 20:57 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Ishaan Gera"}

In contrast, markets such as the UAE, China, Saudi Arabia, Spain and Hong Kong recorded notable gains, indicating effective trade redirection and market substitution by Indian exporters.\n\nThe report mentioned that traditional European trading partners broadly maintained stable shares. Marginal gains in countries like Germany, Italy and Spain helped offset the moderation seen in the Netherlands and the UK, the report noted.\n\nElara Securities said this trend highlights the resilience of India's export ecosystem despite global uncertainties and tariff-related challenges.\n\nThe report expects export resilience to continue through FY27E. Merchandise exports are projected to grow by 4.5-5 per cent in FY27E, compared to an estimated growth of 2 per cent in FY26E.\n\nServices exports are also expected to remain resilient, supported by the ongoing boom in GCC economies, with growth estimated at 12-13 per cent.\n\nIndia's merchandise exports have shown resilience despite tariff headwinds and global demand volatility.\n\nThe report mentioned that this performance has been supported by sustained strength in non-tariffed and higher value-added sectors. Electronics, pharmaceuticals, organic chemicals and engineering goods continue to anchor export performance, with their combined share rising steadily.\n\nOn a year-to-date basis, electronics exports expanded sharply by 37.3 per cent year-on-year. The report said this reflects improved competitiveness and deeper supply-chain integration.\n\nNotably, tariff-sensitive sectors such as marine products have also shown a recovery in export share, suggesting partial absorption of tariff pressures by exporters.\n\nOverall, the report indicated that India's exports are adapting to a changing global trade environment through diversification, value addition and sectoral strength, helping sustain growth momentum despite external challenges.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 13:44 IST", "category": "business", "author": "ANI"}

{"title": "DIY guide: Here's how mutual funds can help you grow your money", "content": "Mutual funds have emerged as one of the most popular investment options for individuals looking to build long-term wealth. Despite their growing popularity, many investors still remain unclear about what mutual funds are and how they work. If you are new to investing or looking for a structured way to diversify your portfolio, understanding mutual funds is a good place to start.\n\nMutual funds offer a simple way to invest across markets without needing deep expertise. They allow investors to participate in equities and debt through professionally managed portfolios, helping spread risk while aiming for better inflation-adjusted returns. From managing market volatility to simplifying investment decisions, mutual funds address many challenges faced by individual investors.\n\nIn this guide, we break down the fundamentals of mutual funds: what they are, why they matter, and how they can fit into your financial plan. Whether you are taking your first step into investing or reassessing your current strategy, this explainer will help you make informed choices to grow and protect your wealth.\n\nWhat is a mutual fund?\n\nA mutual fund is an investment product where money from many investors is collected and invested together in different assets such as shares, bonds and other securities. Instead of selecting and managing individual investments on your own, a professional fund manager takes these decisions on behalf of investors, based on the fund’s stated objective.\n\nEach investor owns units of the mutual fund in proportion to the amount invested. The value of these units or Net Asset Value (NAV), rises or falls depending on how the underlying investments perform, allowing investors to benefit from market growth while spreading risk across multiple securities.\n\nWhy invest through a mutual fund? Can't I invest directly into equities and debt?\n\nInvesting directly in the stock market can be risky. For example, which company's shares should you buy? How do you identify the right companies? Can you analyse annual reports, financial statements and industry trends to make informed decisions? This is where an expertise of a fund manager helps in picking up right stocks at right valulations.\n\nMoreover, individual share prices can be steep. With Rs 5,000, you can barely buy a handful of shares. For instance, India's most expensive listed stock, MRF, costs Rs 1,47,340 a share followed by Honeywell Auto (Rs 33,240) and Page Industries (Rs 34,165).\n\nThe problem is bigger when you wish to invest in debt markets. High investment limits and the lack of easily available of bonds have made it virtually impossible for investors to invest directly in debt markets.\n\nAlso read |Building a one pager personal finance plan that actually works\n\nDo I need a lot of money to invest in mutual funds?\n\nYou don't need a huge amount to invest in mutual funds. With as little as Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000, you can get started, and SIPs let you invest even smaller amounts like Rs 500 a month. Mutual funds have expert fund managers who research and make informed investment decisions, making it accessible to small investors. Discipline is key to earning good returns.\n\nDo mutual funds give guaranteed returns?\n\nNo, they don’t. Mutual fund returns are subject to market risks.\n\nMy bank fixed deposit gives me a guaranteed return. Why should I invest in mutual funds?\n\nFixed deposits (FDs) may offer 6.5-8 percent returns but inflation (4-6 percent) eats into your gains, leaving you with barely 0.5 to 1 percent real return. Your money's purchasing power is silently eroded.\n\nInflation isn't uniform across sectors; medical and education costs rise faster. Investments in a fixed deposit won't be enough. Mutual funds, especially equity funds, can help you reach your long-term goals, and don't forget the tax implications on FD returns.\n\nOur parents invested in fixed deposits because there weren't many options. Today, you can pick mutual funds suited to your needs and goals.\n\nMutual funds are not a shortcut to quick wealth nor are they a replacement for all other savings instruments. What they offer is a disciplined, accessible way to participate in markets, manage risk, and build inflation-beating wealth over time. The key lies in choosing funds aligned to your goals, time horizon and risk appetite and staying invested through market cycles.\n\nIn a world where costs are rising faster than traditional savings, mutual funds provide investors with far more flexibility and opportunity than earlier generations had. With small starting amounts, professional management, and a wide range of options, they make long-term investing both practical and achievable for everyday investors.", "company": "", "date": "January 12, 2026/ 14:50 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

Our understanding is everyone wants that a BJP mayor not be elected.” Even Shinde does not want a BJP mayor in Mumbai, Raut claimed.He said if the corporators are locked up in the hotel, there are different sources of communication to send and receive messages.\n\nThe corporators who have been locked up should be released, the Shiv Sena (UBT) leader added.Shiv Sena leader Sheetal Mhatre said her party and the BJP contested polls as Mahayuti.She said 20 of the 29 corporators have won for the first time and need to know how the BMC functions.”We don’t need to resort to hotel politics.\n\nThe elected corporators have defeated Shiv Sena (UBT) candidates,” Mhatre said.She also rejected the charge that the corporators were corralled into a hotel for better bargaining of posts in the BMC.On Saturday, Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray had said his party could have its mayor if ”Dev” (God) was willing. He also suggested that Shinde’s party was scared of poaching attempts by its ally BJP.”\n\nThere were discussions between Uddhav Thackeray and MNS president Raj Thackeray (on the post of mayor). We are watching it neutrally. There are many things happening behind the curtains,” Raut said.In the recently concluded civic polls, the alliance of the BJP and Shinde-led Sena won a clear majority in the 227-member BMC, securing 89 and 29 seats, respectively.

Early optimism was supported by encouraging IT earnings and signs of progress in India–U.S. trade discussions, which lifted sentiment in the first half.

{"title": "Personal and auto loan calls flood your phone. Should you ever say yes?", "content": "If you have a mobile phone and a bank account, you’ve probably received them. Calls that begin with “Sir/Ma’am, you are eligible for a special personal loan” or “We have an exclusive car loan offer just for you”. They sound helpful, timely, sometimes even reassuring. Low interest, instant disbursal, minimal paperwork.\n\nWhen money feels tight or a purchase is looming, these calls can feel like a lifeline. But they can also be the start of a very expensive mistake.\n\nWhy these calls are so persistent\n\nBanks, NBFCs and loan aggregators are under pressure to grow their retail loan books. Personalloansand auto loans are among the most profitable products they sell. Cold calls, WhatsApp messages and app notifications are simply the cheapest way to push credit quickly.\n\nNot all such calls are fraudulent. Some do come from legitimate lenders or their authorised agents. The problem is that the urgency is artificial. The loan is being sold to you, not tailored for you.\n\n“Pre-approved” doesn’t mean pre-cheap\n\nOne of the most misleading phrases used in these calls is “pre-approved”. It creates a sense of safety, as if the lender has already vetted you and decided the loan is good for you.\n\nIn reality, pre-approval usually just means you meet basic eligibility criteria based on your credit profile. The interest rate, fees and fine print still matter, and these are often revealed only after you show interest.\n\nMany borrowers realise too late that the rate quoted on the phone was conditional, or that processing fees, insurance add-ons and penalties quietly pushed up the real cost.\n\nWhen easy money becomes expensive money\n\nPersonal loans are unsecured, which makes them convenient but also costly. Interest rates can vary widely depending on your credit score, employer profile and lender. What sounds “reasonable” on a call can still be far higher than alternatives like a top-up on an existing loan or a credit card balance transfer.\n\nAuto loans, while secured, can also hide surprises. Longer tenures reduce EMIs but increase total interest. Dealer-linked loans may bundle higher rates in exchange for faster approval or discounts elsewhere.\n\nThe danger isn’t borrowing. It’s borrowing without comparing.\n\nHow desperation clouds judgement\n\nThese calls work best when you’re vulnerable. A medical expense, a sudden job gap, a tight month, a delayed payment. That’s when instant approval sounds like relief.\n\nThis is also when borrowers are least likely to read documents carefully, question charges, or negotiate terms. Some lenders rely on this moment to push loans that look manageable now but become stressful later.\n\nThat’s when a “saviour” starts to resemble a loan shark, not through illegal means, but through aggressive pricing and rigid recovery.\n\nRed flags you should never ignore\n\nIf the caller refuses to share details by email, pressures you to decide immediately, asks for upfront fees, or insists on unusual payment methods, walk away. Legitimate lenders do not need urgency to close a good loan.\n\nAnother warning sign is being asked to share sensitive information casually over the phone. PAN, Aadhaar, OTPs and banking details should never be handed over to someone who called you first.\n\nWhen borrowing does make sense\n\nThere are times when these offers can be useful. If the call comes from your existing bank, the rate is competitive, and the terms are clearly documented, apersonal loanor auto loan can be a practical solution.\n\nThe difference lies in control. You should feel like you’re choosing the loan, not being pushed into it.\n\nWhat to do before you say yes\n\nBefore agreeing to any loan offer, pause and compare. Check rates from at least two other lenders. Ask for the total repayment amount, not just the EMI. Look at foreclosure charges, late payment penalties and whether insurance is optional or compulsory.\n\nMost importantly, ask yourself whether the loan solves a problem or simply postpones it.\n\nFrequent loan calls aren’t inherently evil, but they are not acts of generosity either. They are sales pitches, designed to move fast and ask questions later.\n\nUsed carefully, a loan can smooth cash flow or help you acquire something meaningful. Used carelessly, the same loan can lock you into years of stress.\n\nWhen the phone rings with an “exclusive offer”, remember this: the power lies in how slowly and thoughtfully you respond.", "company": "", "date": "January 17, 2026/ 17:02 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

{"title": "India must build its own AI foundational models, says Vishal Sikka", "content": "Vishal Sikka, founder & CEO of Vianai Systems, has called for India to urgently develop its own foundational artificial intelligence models to avoid becoming a passive consumer of technology built elsewhere. In an interview with CNBC TV18, Sikka -- former CEO of Infosys -- emphasised that India is too large and the stakes too high for the nation to be absent from any layer of the AI ecosystem.\n\n\"We have to be central to AI ... at every layer, in every aspect of AI,\" Sikka stated, ahead of the India AI impact summit scheduled for next month. He argued that India possesses the capability to use and deliver AI at scale and should showcase its innovation and entrepreneurial spirit to the world. He said India must build its own foundation models, develop tools and applications on top, and enable hundreds of millions to deploy them, which are the core underpinning for platforms like ChatGPT.\n\nThe former Infosys CEO highlighted a critical skill gap as a major challenge, describing the current global situation as a \"tale of two cities.\" He noted that out of eight billion people worldwide, only about two million can build AI applications. The number shrinks dramatically to a few hundred thousand who can deploy AI in production, and fewer than 25,000 people on the entire planet possess the skills to create a frontier-level foundational model. \"These are not skills that are pre-ordained by God for a chosen few people… we have to really make these skills much more pervasive,\" he said.\n\nTo address this, Sikka, who is on the board of Stanford's AI center, revealed that the upcoming summit will feature faculty from the university who will teach attendees how to build their own foundational models, aiming to proliferate the skill of building foundation models, which he argued can be learned.\n\nSikka outlined a twofold concern regarding India's AI readiness. The first is the urgency to expand the skill base of people who understand AI's capabilities and limitations. The second is the imminent disruptive effect on key industries, particularly the IT services sector. He pointed out that Large Language Models (LLMs) are \"unreasonably effective at writing software,\" posing a direct challenge to traditional software development and maintenance roles. \"We have a short window of time in which to transform from the previous way of doing things to an AI-led way of doing things,\" Sikka warned, framing it as the most important equation for the times ahead.\n\nHe stressed that the disruption is not a future event but is already happening. To illustrate the magnitude of the shift, he shared an anecdote of a complex system that took 15 experts nine months to build being replicated by a single person in just 14 days using modern AI tools. \"It is not a matter of when is it coming. It is here already,\" he asserted.\n\nReflecting on his early decision to back OpenAI with a donation in 2015, he recalled that allocating resources to high-reward, unconventional ideas like these often seem ‘crazy’ at first. He urged a focus on the future, questioning what current opportunities might be missed today that will seem obvious in 2035. For him, the most significant imminent transformation lies in the complete overhaul of the IT landscape driven by AI.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 12:24 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Alpha Desk"}
{"title": "Travel insurance for seniors is not about price. It is about what gets excluded", "content": "For senior travellers, the most expensive travel insurance policy is not the one with the highest premium. It is the one that looks affordable upfront and then quietly refuses to pay when something goes wrong.\n\nMost people shopping for travel insurance start with price and coverage amount. For seniors, that approach often backfires. The real risks are buried in exclusions, sub-limits and definitions that matter far more as age increases and medical probabilities change.\n\nWhy exclusions matter more after 60\n\nAs we age, insurers assume higher medical risk. They respond not just by raising premiums, but by tightening policy conditions. Many senior policies advertise high medical cover, but then carve it up through exclusions that dramatically reduce real protection.\n\nA hospitalisation claim can be rejected not because treatment was unnecessary, but because the condition is linked to something the insurer classifies as pre-existing, chronic, or related.\n\nUnderstanding these definitions before buying is far more important than shaving a few thousand rupees off the premium.\n\nPre-existing conditions are the biggest minefield\n\nMost senior claims fail here. Many policies define a pre-existing condition broadly. It may include any illness, symptom, diagnosis, or treatment that existed before the policy start date, sometimes going back years. Even controlled conditions like blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid disorders or past cardiac issues can fall into this category.\n\nSome plans offer partial cover for pre-existing conditions, but usually with strict waiting periods, caps, or co-payments. Others exclude them entirely.\n\nIf a senior traveller is hospitalised abroad for a complication that can be linked, even indirectly, to a known condition, insurers often deny the claim. This happens even when the immediate issue appears new.\n\nSub-limits quietly shrink your cover\n\nMany senior plans advertise large medical sums insured. The fine print often tells a different story.\n\nThere may be daily hospital room rent limits, caps on ICU charges, or fixed ceilings for procedures such as cardiac treatment or stroke care. In countries like the US, Canada or parts of Europe, these limits can be exhausted in a single day.\n\nWhat looks like a policy with a large overall cover can effectively behave like a low-cover plan once sub-limits kick in.\n\nCo-pay clauses can be financially painful\n\nCo-pay is common in senior travel insurance. This means the insured must pay a fixed percentage of every claim, often 10 to 25 percent, sometimes more.\n\nA large overseas medical bill combined with a co-pay can still leave families paying several lakhs out of pocket. Many buyers notice co-pay only after a claim arises.\n\nIf two policies differ slightly on premium but one has no co-pay or a lower co-pay, that difference can matter far more than the headline price.\n\nEmergency versus planned treatment matters\n\nTravel insurance covers emergencies, not elective or planned care.\n\nFor seniors, this distinction is critical. If an insurer decides that hospitalisation could have been anticipated due to prior symptoms or existing conditions, they may argue it was not a sudden emergency.\n\nThis interpretation often becomes the basis for rejection. Insurers scrutinise medical records closely, especially for older travellers.\n\nEvacuation and repatriation exclusions are often overlooked\n\nMedical evacuation is one of the most expensive components of overseas care. Many seniors assume it is automatically covered.\n\nIn reality, some policies exclude evacuation related to pre-existing conditions or require insurer approval before evacuation. Delays or technical non-compliance can void coverage.\n\nRepatriation of mortal remains, another sensitive issue, is also subject to conditions that families often discover too late.\n\nAge cut-offs and renewability clauses\n\nSome policies sharply reduce benefits after a certain age, even within the same trip. Others restrict renewals or impose fresh medical underwriting after every journey.\n\nSeniors who travel frequently need to read continuity and renewability terms carefully, not just trip duration limits.\n\nRegulatory guidance helps, but does not replace reading the policy\n\nIndian insurers operate under frameworks laid down by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, which mandates disclosures and policy wording standards. That said, regulation does not eliminate restrictive clauses. It only ensures they are disclosed somewhere in the document.\n\nThe responsibility still lies with the buyer to understand how exclusions operate in real scenarios.\n\nHow seniors should choose differently\n\nInstead of starting with premium, seniors should start with exclusions. Read how pre-existing conditions are defined. Look for sub-limits, co-pay clauses and emergency definitions. Ask insurers for written clarification if anything is unclear.\n\nIt is often better to pay more for a policy that clearly covers likely risks than to save money on one that looks generous but pays little.\n\nFor senior travellers, travel insurance is not a commodity product. It is a risk contract.\n\nA policy that costs more but responds predictably in a medical emergency is cheaper than one that denies claims when families are most vulnerable. When age increases, exclusions are the real price of insurance, not the premium printed on the cover page.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 15:10 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}
{"title": "China’s 2025 trade surplus hits record $1.2 trillion despite US tariffs", "content": "China’s trade surplus climbed to $1.2 trillion in 2025, extending a record run as the tariff war started by President Donald Trump sent exporters in search of markets beyond the US.\n\nShipments to regions like Southeast Asia and Europe made up for a deepening plunge in sales to the US in December, with overall exports increasing 6.6% from a year earlier. That was the quickest growth in three months and faster than any forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists, whose median was for a 3.1% gain.\n\nImports also rose more than expected with a jump of 5.7%, leaving a surplus of $114 billion — the most in six months, according to data from China’s General Administration of Customs on Wednesday. The US share of China’s total exports fell to a historic low of 11% in 2025, according to Bloomberg Economics, a drop of eight percentage points since Trump’s first term.\n\nShipments overseas have boomed through much of the trade war and after the recent de-escalation of tensions with the Trump administration. But as China navigates tariffs and growing economic protectionism around the world, it’s stirring anxiety abroad as it pours exports into Africa, Latin America and beyond.\n\nThe swelling surplus also underscores the imbalance between China’s manufacturing strength and stubbornly weak domestic consumption. While exports have powered the world’s second-biggest economy, its years-long property slump and falling investment are restraining the country’s appetite for foreign goods.\n\nDespite a global backlash, Chinese companies aggressively sought out customers in other markets when shipments to the US plunged after Trump hiked tariffs. Exports to the US slumped more than 30% in December, among their worst declines this year.\n\nFor the full year of 2025, exports to Africa saw the fastest growth among major regions with a 26% gain from a year ago. Shipments to the Southeast Asian nations in the Asean group expanded 13%, and those to the European Union and Latin America rose 8% and 7% respectively. Exports to the US plunged 20%.\n\nLooking ahead, global demand for China’s goods and the competitiveness of its exports will likely keep foreign shipments on the rise in 2026, especially if the trade ceasefire with the US holds.\n\nThis week, Trump announced new tariffs on goods from countries trading with Iran, threatening to derail his one-year truce with China, the world’s top buyer of Iranian oil.\n\nOther risks abound. Tensions over the influx of goods are building with major partners such as Europe. And a high base of comparison last year means export growth will probably moderate in the months ahead.\n\n“The external environment for China’s trade development is still grim and complex” in 2026 due to slower global economic growth and geopolitical fragmentation, Wang Jun, deputy head of the customs authority, said during a briefing in Beijing Wednesday. But “with more diversified trading partners and strengthened resilience, the fundamentals of China’s trade remain solid,” he said.\n\nThe Chinese government has also moved to rein in the exports of some goods to ease trade tensions and as part of an effort to address excess capacity in several industries that’s adding deflationary pressure on the economy.\n\nAuthorities will cancel the export tax rebates on hundreds of products including solar cells and batteries from April, according to an official announcement on Friday.\n\nExports of higher-value goods surged in 2025, with products including semiconductors, cars and ships recording gains of more than 20% from a year ago. Meanwhile, some lower-end exports such as toys, shoes and clothing contracted.\n\nLynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Groep NV, warned China is facing “some pushback” as its higher-end products become more competitive globally.\n\n“The key to continuing win-win cooperation is to boost China’s domestic demand and support imports,” he said. Overall, the stronger-than-forecast figures are “an encouraging sign for China as well as trading partners, given we were looking at a potential deceleration due to last year’s frontloading effect.”", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 13:15 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Bloomberg"}

The index rose four-tenths of a percent but failed to close above the previous day‚Äôs high. Strong buying interest emerged from the day‚Äôs low, with the index reclaiming the 100-day EMA and forming a Piercing Line‚Äìtype pattern (a bullish reversal pattern). This raised some confidence among bulls; however, momentum indicators still need to align for a stronger upside going forward. Hence, the sustainability of this rebound remains the key factor to watch.\n\nThe Nifty 50 needs to reclaim and sustain convincingly above the psychological 26,000 zone‚Äîwhich coincides with the 20-day EMA and the midline of the Bollinger Bands‚Äîfor a further uptrend towards 26,200‚Äì26,300. Until then, consolidation may continue, with crucial support placed at 25,450, experts said.\n\nThe index opened below 25,700 and extended its downtrend to 25,473 but bounced back in the second half of the session and traded higher for the remainder of the day, closing 107 points (0.42 percent) higher at 25,790. The index formed a bullish candle with a long lower shadow on the daily charts, indicating a significant short-term turnaround in the market.\n\n‚ÄúThis is a positive indication, and one may expect further upside in the short term. The underlying trend of the Nifty seems to have turned up following the sharp weakness seen last week,‚Äù said Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities.\n\nHaving recovered decisively from key lower levels, the Nifty could advance towards the next hurdle of 26,000‚Äì26,100 levels over the next few sessions, according to him.\n\nHowever, the Nifty 50 index remains well below its short- and medium-term moving averages, although it has moved back above the 100-day EMA on a closing basis. The RSI rebounded to 42.84 but remains well below the reference line. The MACD continued to maintain a bearish crossover, while the histogram weakened further.\n\n‚ÄúOn the hourly chart, the RSI has moved out of the oversold zone, indicating early signs of recovery. However, this half-session buying is not expected to change the overall market sentiment,‚Äù said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities.\n\n‚ÄúWe remain watchful, as the Nifty faces resistance in the 26,000‚Äì26,100 zone, where selling pressure may re-emerge. On the lower end, immediate and crucial support is placed at 25,650,‚Äù he added.\n\nWeekly options data also suggest that 26,000 is expected to be a key resistance level for the Nifty 50, as it has the maximum Call open interest. On the downside, support is seen in the 25,700‚Äì25,500 range, where maximum Put open interest is placed.\n\nThe Bank Nifty also opened lower and slipped marginally below the 50-day EMA (58,900) intraday, as well as below support trendlines, but staged a strong comeback later in the session. The banking index rallied 199 points (0.34 percent) to close at 59,450 after a three-day losing streak and ended above the midline of the Bollinger Bands. It gained nearly 600 points from the day‚Äôs low of 58,864 but failed to close above the previous day‚Äôs high and continued to form a lower-low structure for the fifth consecutive session.\n\nMomentum indicators are not showing strength, raising doubts over the sustainability of this rebound. The index needs to sustain above short-term moving averages and the midline of the Bollinger Bands for bulls to regain a strong presence; until then, consolidation may continue.\n\nThe RSI inched up to 51.4 but remains below the reference line, while the MACD continued with a bearish crossover and a further decline in the histogram.\n\n‚ÄúOn the hourly chart, the RSI has entered a bullish crossover, suggesting improving intraday momentum. However, on the daily chart, the RSI remains weak. Given this mixed setup, a cautious stance is advisable,‚Äù said Vatsal Bhuva, Technical Analyst at LKP Securities.\n\nAccording to him, immediate support for the index is placed at 58,900, while resistance is seen near the 59,500 level.\n\nMeanwhile, the India VIX, which measures expected market volatility, signalled further caution and discomfort for bulls. It attempted to move towards its 200-day EMA (12.14) intraday before closing 4.05 percent higher at 11.37, extending its uptrend for the third consecutive session.", "company": "", "date": "January 12, 2026/ 17:37 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar"}

{"title": "Infosys shares jump over 5% after Q3 results; brokerages upbeat on guidance hike, deal wins", "content": "Shares of Infosys Ltd rallied sharply on Friday, rising over 5 percent, as investors reacted positively to the IT major’s Q3 FY26 results, a raised revenue growth outlook, and upbeat brokerage commentary following a strong rally in its US-listed ADRs.\n\nInfosysstock climbed 5.14 percent to a high or Rs 1,682.1 in early trade, marking a firm rebound after the company’s earnings announcement earlier this week. The stock had ended the previous session at Rs 1,608.9 on the NSE.\n\nThe buying interest comes despite Infosys reporting a 2.2 percent year-on-year decline in consolidated net profit for the fiscal third quarter, which was weighed down by a one-time labour code-related charge. Investors appeared to look past the headline profit miss, focusing instead on steady constant-currency revenue growth, resilient adjusted margins, and robust large-deal momentum.\n\nInfosys raised its FY26 revenue growth guidance to 3-3.5 percent in constant currency terms, citing improving demand visibility and strong execution, while maintaining its operating margin outlook. Large deal wins stood at $4.8 billion during the quarter, including two mega deals, supporting medium-term revenue visibility.\n\nSentiment was also supported by a sharp rally in Infosys’ American Depository Receipts, which jumped about 8 percent over two US trading sessions following the results, signalling a positive offshore investor response.\n\nBrokerages reiterated bullish views on the stock after the earnings announcement. CLSA maintained an ‘Outperform’ rating on Infosys with a target price of Rs 1,779 per share, while HSBC reiterated its ‘Buy’ call with a higher target price of Rs 1,870 per share, citing improving demand commentary, greater clarity on AI-led spending, and stabilising US corporate sentiment.\n\nDespite Friday’s sharp rebound, Infosys shares remain down about 13 percent over the past one year, underperforming the Nifty 50, which has risen more than 10 percent over the same period. Brokerages say that this has kept the stock firmly on investors' radar for a potential re-rating.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

{"title": "MidCap, SmallCap inflows in 2025 hit record high despite scheme delivers muted returns", "content": "Inflows into mid-cap and small-cap mutual fund schemes touched record levels in 2025 despite sharp volatility in broader markets, the absence of foreign investors from these segments, stretched valuations, and muted earnings.\n\nAMFI data showed that mid-cap schemes received Rs 49,939 crore during the year, up 46 percent from a year earlier, while small-cap schemes attracted Rs 52,321 crore, an increase of 53 percent.\n\nMarket performance remained mixed during the period. The BSE MidCap index rose 1.1 percent in 2025, while the BSE SmallCap index declined 6.6 percent. In comparison, the Sensex and Nifty gained nearly 9 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively.\n\nAxis Securities’ Rajesh Palviya said the inflows were supported by steady SIP investments and investors continuing to add to their mutual fund holdings, based on the strong three-year and five-year outperformance of mid-cap and small-cap stocks over large-cap shares.\n\nMarket breadth stayed weak. Of the 140 stocks in the BSE MidCap index, 86 ended the year with negative returns, while in the BSE SmallCap index, 871 of the 1,186 stocks were in the red. In the BSE100 index, 61 stocks posted gains and 39 recorded losses.\n\nPalviya said investors have been using market declines to average their investments, as SIP inflows into mid-cap and small-cap schemes continue on a regular basis.\n\nDomestic investors have been the main source of net inflows over the past two years and have preferred mid-cap and small-cap schemes over large-cap funds. Foreign investors have largely stayed away from these segments and have mainly been selling large-cap stocks, which has further concentrated domestic flows into mid-cap and small-cap schemes.\n\nThe share of mid-cap and small-cap schemes in total equity inflows also increased during the year. Mid-cap funds accounted for a record 14.26 percent of total equity inflows, up from 8.7 percent in 2024 and 14.18 percent in 2023. Small-cap funds also saw their share rise to a two-year high of 14.26 percent, compared with 8.68 percent in 2024 and 25.4 percent in 2023.\n\nTotal equity inflows for the year stood at Rs 3.51 lakh crore, down 11.19 percent from Rs 3.94 lakh crore in 2024 and Rs 1.62 lakh crore in 2023.\n\nAnalysts said the absence of outflows despite nearly 16 months of muted returns indicates continued investor commitment. They said many investors remain focused on a three- to four-year horizon, even as near-term returns have been weak, while investment in assets such as gold and silver at current elevated prices is harder to justify for long-term allocations.\n\nIndependent research analyst Ambreesh Baliga said inflows into mutual funds are likely to continue going ahead as mid-cap and small-cap funds have delivered better results than individual portfolios. While many individual portfolios are down 20 percent to 30 percent or more, he said even the worst-performing mid-cap and small-cap funds were down only about 5 percent to 6 percent as of the end of December.\n\nBaliga said investor interest remains as long as losses are limited. He added that when losses become large, investors stop averaging, liquidity in the secondary market declines, selling pressure rises, and stocks can fall further, sometimes leading to margin calls.", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 06:01 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Ravindra Sonavane"}

{"title": "Fast-track demergers for corporate restructuring face tax roadblocks", "content": "Fast-track demergers, introduced by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) to make corporate restructuring quicker, cheaper and more business-friendly, are running into unexpected tax hurdles that threaten to blunt their impact, tax and legal experts said.\n\nOn September 4, 2025, the MCA allowed Indian companies to carry out demergers through the fast-track route — a process that bypasses the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and instead requires approval only from the regional director of the MCA. The move was part of a broader push to unclog tribunals and make routine corporate reorganisations less time-consuming and litigation heavy.\n\nUnder the traditional NCLT route, even simple intra-group demergers often take 9–12 months, involve multiple hearings, creditor approvals and court filings, and impose significant legal and compliance costs. This has made restructuring slow and expensive, particularly for unlisted and closely held groups that regularly hive off businesses into separate vehicles for funding, regulatory compliance, or operational focus.\n\nFast-track demergers were therefore designed to allow companies to split businesses without going through the tribunal, provided there is no objection from shareholders or creditors. For family-owned and promoter-driven groups, this is critical for separating mature cash-generating businesses from high-growth units, attracting investors, or ring-fencing risks — all without changing the underlying ownership.\n\nHowever, unlike traditional NCLT-approved demergers, fast-track demergers currently do not enjoy tax neutrality under the Income Tax Act, 2025, exposing companies and their shareholders to significant tax liabilities.\n\nAt the core of the problem is the definition of “demerger” under the tax law. While the Companies Act provides for both tribunal-approved demergers under Sections 230–232 and fast-track demergers under Section 233, the Income Tax Act grants tax neutrality only to demergers carried out under the NCLT route. Section 233 is not referenced, effectively making fast-track demergers taxable.\n\n“Intra-group mergers and demergers are routine corporate restructuring exercises that do not change beneficial ownership. Yet fast-track demergers are currently treated as taxable transfers,” said Binoy Parikh, partner at Katalyst Advisors.\n\nUnder the existing framework, a company transferring assets or shares under a fast-track demerger could face capital gains tax in the range of 12.5% to 20%. The impact can be even harsher for shareholders, who may be taxed on shares received in the resulting company at rates going up to 36% if the transaction is treated as a deemed dividend rather than a capital gains transfer.\n\n“There is a greater risk of tax incidence in the hands of shareholders, where it could be considered a deemed dividend taxed at 36% instead of capital gains taxed at 15%,” Parikh said. “Unlike mergers, fast-track demergers currently do not enjoy tax neutrality, making otherwise genuine intra-group reorganisations commercially unviable.”\n\nThe issue is particularly acute for unlisted companies, which are the primary users of the fast-track route. Listed companies typically prefer the NCLT process, where tax neutrality continues to apply.\n\nLegal experts say the disconnect appears to be a drafting gap between corporate law and tax law rather than a deliberate policy choice.\n\n“The absence of reference to Section 233 of the Companies Act, 2013 within the definition of ‘demerger’ under the Income Tax Act, 2025 appears to be purely inadvertent,” said Amit Singhania, managing partner at Areete Law Offices. “It would be helpful if this is clarified in the tax proposals in Budget 2026.”\n\nBeyond domestic restructurings, outbound demergers — where assets are transferred to a foreign company — face even steeper tax obstacles.\n\n“In India, tax neutrality for demergers is largely restricted to cases where the resulting company is an Indian entity,” said Ravi Mehta, leader, transaction tax at Bhuta Shah & Co. “While inbound demergers may achieve tax neutrality if conditions under the law are met, outbound demergers continue to face significant tax hurdles.”\n\nIn such structures, the transfer of assets by an Indian company to a foreign entity typically triggers capital gains tax, shareholders may be taxed on receipt of foreign shares, and accumulated losses cannot usually be carried forward.\n\nTax experts say unless the anomaly around fast-track demergers is fixed, companies may be forced to continue using the slower tribunal route, undermining the MCA’s objective of making corporate restructuring faster, cheaper and more aligned with business needs.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 15:48 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Pavan Burugula"}
{"title": "Essar Energy Transition posts record domestic fuel sales at Stanlow refinery in 2025", "content": "Essar Energy Transition, the Essar Group’s UK-based refining and energy transition arm, recorded its highest-ever domestic fuel sales in 2025, driven by higher refinery throughput and a sharp increase in demand for locally produced fuels as Britain’s refining capacity shrank during the year.\n\nThe company’s Stanlow refinery at Ellesmere Port near Liverpool processed about 8% more crude in 2025 compared with the previous year, with dispatch volumes approaching historic highs, according to a statement released on January 14.\n\nStanlow is one of the UK’s six remaining oil refineries. Two facilities were shut during 2025, tightening fuel availability and increasing dependence on imports, a backdrop that helped boost demand for domestic supply.\n\nEssar said its wider logistics network — including terminals at Kingsbury, Northampton, Grangemouth, Oikos and Grays — enabled it to supply fuel to rail, bus and commercial transport operators when shortages emerged in parts of the country.\n\nThe company also expanded its downstream reach. Its Essar-branded retail network increased to 58 petrol stations, while it supplies more than 100 dealer-owned forecourts across the UK. In December, it rolled out price reductions at company-leased, dealer-operated sites, which it said lifted volumes.\n\nIn aviation fuels, Essar now directly supplies 10 major UK airports, adding to growth in a segment that has seen strong recovery in passenger and cargo traffic.\n\nAlongside higher sales, the company completed a major maintenance and upgrade programme at Stanlow, investing about $100 million as part of a wider $350 million capital expenditure plan. The work increased the refinery’s processing capacity by roughly 8% and included installation of the UK’s first hydrogen-ready furnace, a step aimed at lowering emissions and supporting future low-carbon fuel production.\n\nDeepak Maheshwari, chief executive of EET Fuels, said the performance underscored the role of domestic refining in the UK’s energy system. He also said the company was pushing for refiners to be included under the UK’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which would impose charges on high-carbon imports.\n\nEssar Energy Transition plans to invest around $3 billion over the next five years in low-carbon energy projects in the UK, including hydrogen and sustainable fuels, as it looks to reposition Stanlow as a hub for the country’s energy transition.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 22:20 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Deborshi Chaki"}

Reliance Jio’s performance is likely to be supported by higher average revenue per user (ARPU) and subscriber additions, translating into steady growth in operating profit.\n\nYes Securities expects RIL’s consumer businesses to remain resilient, with the brokerage highlighting that ‘Jio [is expected to report] increased ARPU and subscribers while the Retail segment EBITDA margins [are] to sustain on a growing topline.’ Reliance Retail is expected to maintain its gradual recovery, contributing positively to consolidated EBITDA during the quarter.\n\nReliance Industries Q3 Results LIVE: O2C recovery to anchor RIL’s Q3 financial results\n\nThe O2C business is expected to be a key driver of RIL’s quarterly performance. Higher Singapore gross refining margins during the quarter and improved refinery throughput are likely to boost refining earnings, even as petrochemical spreads remain relatively soft.\n\nICICI Securities expects the downstream and consumer segments to lead RIL’s earnings momentum. ‘Retail, RJio, O2C [are expected] to drive earnings growth YoY’, with stronger refining margins supporting O2C performance, the brokerage said.\n\nBrokerage notes to clients said that improved refining economics should more than offset weaker petrochemical spreads, resulting in a year-on-year improvement in overall O2C profitability.\n\nReliance Industries Q3 Results LIVE: Shares up 1% ahead of earnings announcement\n\nReliance Industries (RIL) shares rose 1.29% to trade at Rs 1,477.60 apiece.

On the other hand, Nifty PSU Bank, Metal added 4.5% each and Nifty IT index rose 2.8%.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) extended their selling in this week also as they offloaded equities worth Rs 14,265.58 crore. In contrast, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) provided support to the market, purchasing equities worth RS 16,173.69 crore.\n\n\"The Indian equity markets experienced a range-bound trading week, with the benchmark index oscillating within the confines of its 50 and 100-day EMAs. Despite heightened intraday volatility and sharp swings in both directions, the Nifty50 concluded the truncated week on a subdued note, settling a tad below the 25700 mark and registering a marginal weekly gain of 0.04%,\" said Osho Krishan, Chief Manager -Technical and Derivative research at Angel One.\n\n\"The shortened trading week was eventful, influenced by a mix of global and domestic developments. Persistent concerns around trade tariffs and escalating geopolitical tensions continued to weigh on investor sentiment, fostering a cautious market environment. At the same time, ongoing quarterly earnings announcements and key macroeconomic data provided selective opportunities across sectors. Despite these headwinds, the market exhibited notable resilience. The Nifty50 index managed to contain downside risks, holding near the key EMA on the daily charts, underscoring the underlying strength and consolidation phase in the broader market structure.\"\n\n\"Going forward, it remains crucial to closely monitor global developments, particularly those related to trade tariffs and geopolitical tensions, as these factors are likely to act as significant catalysts in shaping near-term market trends. Additionally, several heavyweight constituents of the Nifty are scheduled to announce their earnings over the weekend, the impact of which is expected to be reflected in market action in the forthcoming sessions. In this backdrop, a prudent and disciplined approach is recommended, with market participants aligning their strategies around the aforementioned technical levels,\" he added.\n\nThe BSE Small-cap index declined nearly 0.5 percent during the week.

Technically, this market action signal formation of high wave type candle pattern after a sharp weakness of previous week. This reflects ongoing volatility in the market.\n\nThe underlying trend of Nifty remains choppy. A sustainable move above 25900 could open further upside for the next week. However, a slide below the support of 25500 could trigger more downside in the market ahead.\n\nAjit Mishra â€“ SVP, Research, Religare Broking\n\nThe ongoing tussle around the medium-term moving average, the 100 DEMA near the 25,600 zone, is keeping participants cautious. The market is likely to take cues from the earnings announcements of key heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank in early trade on Monday, which could determine the next directional move.\n\nUntil then, participants are advised to maintain a selective, stock-specific approach, focusing on sectors showing relative strength such as IT, financials and metals, while adhering to disciplined risk management in the prevailing volatile environment.\n\nAmol Athawale, VP Technical Research, Kotak Securities\n\nWe are of the view that the current market formation is volatile and non-directional, and the short-term activity indicating a non-directional trend is likely to continue in the near future. On the downside, 25,500/83000 and 25,400/82700 would act as key support zones, while the daily SMA (Simple Moving Average) at 25,950/84600 and the 20-day SMA at 26,000/84800 would be crucial resistance levels for the bulls.\n\nFor Bank Nifty, as long as it is trading above the 20-day SMA at 59,500, the uptrend is likely to continue. On the higher side, it could move up to 60,500. Further upside potential may lift the index up to 60,800. Conversely, if it falls below the 20-day SMA at 59,500, the uptrend would become vulnerable.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

{"title": "Took a personal loan and changed your mind? What the cooling-off period really lets you reverse and what it doesn’t", "content": "Taking a personal loan can feel like a big financial commitment. You compare lenders, interest rates and repayment tenures, and once the approval comes through, you may feel relieved — or quickly second-guess your choice. In India, borrowers are sometimes given a “cooling-off” period, a brief window after loan approval during which they can rethink or even cancel the loan with minimal cost. But how far does this right extend, what can you undo, and what’s final once that window closes? Here’s a fact-based look using the latest banking and consumer finance sources.\n\nWhat exactly the cooling-off period means\n\nA cooling-off period is essentially a short time after apersonal loanis sanctioned — and often after it’s disbursed — during which a borrower can cancel the loan agreement without facing penalties or large extra costs. It is designed to protect borrowers from rushed decisions and let them reconsider the loan after seeing the final terms in the sanction letter and key facts statement. This form of borrower protection has become more visible with lenders and regulators trying to increase transparency in lending.\n\nIn simple terms, if you’ve just been approved for a personal loan but then decide it’s not suitable — because of the interest rate, EMIs, hidden charges, or a better alternative elsewhere — the cooling-off period gives you the right to undo that commitment within a short timeframe.\n\nHow long the cooling-off period usually lasts\n\nThere is no single uniform cooling-off duration across all banks and financial institutions in India. Different lenders set their own periods, which generally range from 3 to 15 days after approval or disbursal of the personal loan. Some lenders, especially those offering digitalloans,may mandate a shorter minimum period — even as short as one day — under RBI-aligned digital lending guidelines.\n\nImported personal loans — those processed through apps or online platforms — often include specific cooling-off provisions, with lenders required to disclose these terms clearly in the loan documentation and key facts statement.\n\nWhat you can undo during the cooling-off period\n\nIf you decide within the cooling-off window that you no longer want the loan, you can cancel the personal loan without penalty. You typically only need to inform the lender in writing, through email or the lender’s app, and return any disbursed amount.\n\nMost lenders won’t charge a cancellation fee during this period, though some may retain non-refundable processing fees if these were already charged before or at disbursal. Always check your loan agreement to confirm whether the processing fee is refundable under the cooling-off clause.\n\nImportantly, pulling out during the cooling-off period usually won’t harm your credit score. Since the loan is effectively not activated as an ongoing obligation, it doesn’t show as an active loan in credit bureau records in most cases.\n\nWhat you cannot undo once the cooling-off period ends\n\nOnce the cooling-off period expires, your ability to undo the loan vanishes. At that point, the loan is considered active, and you are legally bound to the repayment schedule and terms agreed upon. Simply returning the money after the cooling-off window has closed doesn’t automatically cancel your obligations — you’d effectively be prepaying or foreclosing the loan.\n\nClosing or prepaying a personal loan after the cooling-off period is a different exercise. While RBI recently directed that pre-payment charges won’t apply on floating-rate loans for most individual borrowers starting 2026, foreclosure or prepayment after the cooling period usually involves normal repayment procedures and sometimes charges depending on loan type and terms.\n\nAlso, once the loan is active in your account, even if you later repay it swiftly, the original credit enquiry and account opening may still have a small impact on your credit file — something a clean cancellation during the cooling-off period avoids.\n\nWhen this period applies\n\nNot all personal loans automatically come with a cooling-off period. Many traditional bank loans still don’t include a defined cooling period unless the lender’s policy specifically provides it. However, for digital lending or digital personal loans, the cooling-off window is more commonly included under RBI’s digital lending guidelines, helping guard against impulsive or ill-informed borrowing.\n\nBecause the existence and length of the cooling-off period can vary by lender — and sometimes by loan product — experts recommend closely reading your personal loan agreement before signing or accepting disbursal.\n\nHow to exercise your cooling-off rights\n\nIf you decide to cancel within the cooling-off period, the steps are usually straightforward but must be done quickly:\n\n· Check your loan agreement for the exact cooling-off duration and how the lender defines it.\n\n· Communicate your intention in writing to the lender promptly — via email, letter, or the lender’s app — stating you are withdrawing from the loan within the cooling-off period.\n\n· Return any disbursed funds according to the lender’s instructions.\n\n· Request written confirmation that your loan has been cancelled and you hold no further obligations.\n\nThese steps ensure a clean exit without lingering liability or miscommunication.\n\nCooling-off vs prepayment: A key distinction\n\nIt’s important to distinguish between the cooling-off period and prepayment/foreclosure:\n\n· Cooling-off period cancellation means stopping the loan before it becomes an ongoing debt and often without penalty.\n\n· Prepayment or foreclosure means actively repaying a live loan earlier than its tenure — typically after the cooling period — which may involve charges, though recent RBI rules limit such charges on certain loans.\n\nBoth achieve the end of the loan, but the legal, credit and cost implications are quite different.\n\nFinal takeaway: Act fast and read closely\n\nIf you have second thoughts after booking or receiving a personal loan, the cooling-off period — where offered — can be a valuable safety net, letting you reverse the commitment without penalties and without lasting credit impact. But it’s time-sensitive and lender-specific, so decisive action and careful reading of your loan documents can save you from expensive or long-term obligations that no longer suit your financial plans.", "company": "", "date": "January 18, 2026/ 08:32 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

{"title": "SEBI notifies revamp of mutual fund regulation; to come into effect from April 1", "content": "The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has notified the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 2026, marking a comprehensive overhaul of the mutual fund regulatory framework with a focus on investor protection, tighter control over expenses, stronger governance and clearer accountability of asset management companies (AMCs) and trustees. These regulations shall come into force with effect from April 1, 2026.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on December 17, during its board meeting approved a comprehensive overhaul of mutual fund regulations aimed at improving cost transparency and reducing the expense burden on investors.\n\nAlso read:Mutual fund expense ratio: What it really pays for and why SEBI’s latest changes matter\n\nThe new regulations replace the earlier regime and significantly expand the responsibilities of trustees and independent directors, who will now be required to exercise closer oversight over investment management agreements, compensation paid by schemes, service contracts with related parties and the overall reasonableness of fees charged to investors. Trustees have also been mandated to identify deficiencies, communicate them to AMCs in writing and monitor their rectification.\n\nOne of the key highlights is regarding TER. The regulations notes that only specified expenses can be charged to schemes under the Total Expense Ratio (TER) framework. Charges to investors are restricted to the base expense ratio, permitted brokerage costs, transaction costs related to trade execution, statutory levies and exit loads, as may be specified by SEBI. Any expense not expressly allowed under the TER framework will have to be borne by the AMC, trustees or sponsors and cannot be passed on to investors. The rules also clarify that transaction costs incurred for trade execution will not form part of the base expense ratio, reinforcing transparency in how scheme expenses are presented.\n\nThe regulation also includes governance-based checks, requiring trustees and independent directors to review compensation arrangements and ensure that remuneration structures do not encourage conflicts of interest or misalignment with investor interests.\n\nThe regulations also strengthen disclosure and reporting requirements. Annual reports must include detailed trustee commentary on scheme performance with justification, comprehensive per-unit historical statistics and clear disclosures on expenses and valuation.

{"title": "Apples, bananas, nuts: Why a US tariff move on Iran could still hurt India in select areas", "content": "A proposed move by the US to impose a 25 percent tariff on countries trading with Iran is unlikely to dent India’s trade. Iran today accounts for barely 0.3 percent of India’s total trade, making it a marginal partner in aggregate. But the small headline number masks a sharper risk in some products where Iran remains an important supplier, leaving India exposed if curbs on Iran-linked trade increases.\n\nThe exposure is most visible on the import side, where India’s dependence on Iran is narrow but concentrated. In 2024, Iran supplied nearly 60 percent of India’s pistachio imports, about 39 percent of almonds and close to 23 percent of apples, according to trade data. These are not fringe commodities. Nuts and fruits are staples of India’s urban consumption basket, and their prices are susceptible to supply shocks. Any disruption in sourcing, whether due to higher compliance costs, shipping frictions or indirect sanctions risk, could quickly translate into price pressures for consumers.\n\nIndia’s export exposure to Iran is smaller in value terms, but in some lines it is even more concentrated. Iran absorbs nearly all of India’s exports of rosin and certain resin products and remains an important destination for bananas, oil-cake, and select machinery and chemical items. For exporters, especially in agriculture, redirecting shipments is rarely frictionless. Perishable goods like bananas have limited shelf life, and alternative markets often come with different standards, pricing dynamics or logistics costs.\n\nThese vulnerabilities are the residue of a trade relationship that has already shrunk dramatically. Since the reimposition of US sanctions in 2019, India–Iran trade has collapsed by nearly 87 percent, falling to $2.3 billion in 2024 from $17.6 billion in 2019. The most dramatic shift has been in energy. Mineral fuels once accounted for over 90 percent of India’s imports from Iran; that trade has all but vanished, plunging by 99 percent since 2019.\n\nWhat remains is a very different trade mix. India still imports roughly $1 billion worth of goods from Iran, but more than 80 percent of this now consists of organic chemicals, edible fruits and nuts. Energy has been replaced by food and intermediate inputs as the backbone of the relationship—categories where substitution is often harder and price volatility more visible.\n\nExports tell a similar story of contraction. India’s shipments to Iran have fallen 68 percent from their pre-sanctions peak. In 2024, exports stood at $1.3 billion, down sharply from $3.9 billion in 2019 and $5.4 billion in 2013. While the absolute numbers are smaller, the remaining trade is tightly concentrated in a few product lines, magnifying the impact of any further disruption.", "company": "", "date": "January 13, 2026/ 16:35 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Ishaan Gera"}

{"title": "Personal loan top-ups sound easy. Here’s when they actually make financial sense", "content": "A personal loan top-up is often sold as the simplest solution when you need extra cash. The pitch is familiar. You already have a loan, you have been paying on time, and the bank is willing to lend you more with minimal paperwork. The money can hit your account in a day or two, sometimes even faster.\n\nThat convenience is real. So are the risks.\n\nWhat a top-up really does to your loan\n\nA top-up is not a separateloan.It is an addition to your existingpersonal loan.The lender increases the outstanding amount and then reworks either your EMI, your tenure, or both.\n\nOn paper, this feels harmless. The EMI may go up only slightly, or sometimes not at all if the bank extends the tenure. But that is where borrowers often stop reading.\n\nWhat matters is not just the monthly number, but how long you will now be repaying the loan and how much extra interest you will end up paying over time.\n\nWhy top-ups can be genuinely useful\n\nTop-ups work best when the need is real and time-sensitive. Medical expenses, urgent home repairs, or plugging a short-term cash gap are situations where speed matters more than perfect optimisation.\n\nBecause you are an existing customer with a repayment track record, lenders may offer a top-up at a lower rate than a fresh personal loan taken at the same time. Processing fees are usually lower, and documentation is minimal. If your income has improved since you took the original loan, the pricing can sometimes be reasonable.\n\nIn these cases, a top-up can be cheaper and faster than starting from scratch.\n\nWhere people get caught out\n\nThe biggest mistake is focusing only on the EMI. Many lenders quietly extend the tenure when adding a top-up. You may feel comfortable paying the revised EMI, but you could be signing up to pay interest for several extra years.\n\nAnother issue is lack of clarity. Some banks blend the interest rate of the original loan and the top-up, making it hard to see what the new borrowing is actually costing you. Borrowers often accept the offer without asking for a fresh repayment schedule.\n\nThere is also a behavioural trap. Because top-ups are easy, they are often used for lifestyle spending. A holiday, gadgets or a celebration financed through a top-up can linger as debt long after the excitement is gone.\n\nTop-up versus fresh loan, the right way to compare\n\nDo not compare EMIs. Compare total repayment. Ask the lender for two clear calculations. One showing the revised loan if you take the top-up, including the new tenure and total interest. Another showing the cost of a fresh personal loan for the same amount over a shorter tenure.\n\nIn some cases, especially if interest rates have fallen or your credit profile has improved, a fresh loan with a higher EMI but shorter tenure can be cheaper overall. It also gives you flexibility. You can prepay or close one loan without affecting the other.\n\nWith a top-up, everything is bundled together. That can limit your options later.\n\nWhat regulators expect you to watch for\n\nIndian lending rules require lenders to clearly disclose changes in tenure, EMI and total repayment when offering additional credit. The Reserve Bank of India has repeatedly stressed the importance of informed borrower consent, especially as unsecured lending grows.\n\nAs a borrower, you should insist on a revised amortisation schedule. If the bank cannot clearly explain how much more you will pay over the life of the loan, that is a warning sign.\n\nWhen a top-up is usually a bad idea\n\nIf your monthly budget already feels tight, adding more debt is risky, even if the EMI looks manageable today. A top-up also makes little sense if you are nearing a job change, business transition or any period of income uncertainty.\n\nAnd if the top-up stretches your loan far beyond the time frame you originally planned for, it deserves serious reconsideration.\n\nA personal loan top-up is not automatically good or bad. It is simply easy. That ease can help in the right situation, but it can also quietly increase the cost of borrowing if you do not slow down and examine the details. Look beyond the EMI, question the tenure, and be clear about why you need the money.\n\nIf the answer is convenience alone, it may be worth thinking twice.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 18:10 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

{"title": "MC EXCLUSIVETimeliness strictly spelled in IBC 2.0, debt recovery for banks may double from current levels: Baijayant Panda", "content": "The revamped insolvency and bankruptcy code is a \"reboot\" of the insolvency ecosystem, which will help to dramatically reduce the time taken to conclude the resolution process, and enhance recoveries for the creditors – to the extent of doubling it, Baijayant Panda, chairperson of the Parliament’s Select Committee on IBC told Moneycontrol on Wednesday.\n\nIn an exclusive interview, Panda said that in the new Act, the timelines are \"strictly-spelled\" for each stage of the resolution process. \"In the last three-four years, on an annual basis, Rs 50,000-60,000 crore was being recovered by banks from bad assets, in which IBC played a big role. My guess is, this figure can double, once the amended IBC law is enacted.\"\n\nPanda chaired the 24-member Select Committee of the Parliament--formed in October 2025--which examined 68 amendments introduced in the Principle Act of 2016, through the new Bill – introduced in the Parliament on August 12, 2025.\n\nThe most crucial suggestion of the Committee was to impose a three-month timeline on the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) for disposing of IBC-appeals. At present, no timeline for NCLAT exists. The Committee in its report said that the \"effectiveness of the Code rests on a strict time-bound framework, the Committee therefore emphasize that undue appellate delays risk undermining the efficiency and certainty of the insolvency resolution process.\"\n\nThe Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) prescribes a 330-day timeline for the conclusion of the entire corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) – which ends with approval of the resolution plan by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).\n\nHowever, according to Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India’s (IBBI) newsletter, as of March 2025, the average time taken for approval of resolution plan by the NCLT was 717 days – way more than the 330-day timeline prescribed in the Code.\n\nTo address, the new IBC Bill has imposed timelines in \"stages\", said Panda. According to provisions of the new bill, the NCLT should decide on the application of admitting a case for resolution process within 14 days. Any withdrawal application for the resolution process must be decided within 30 days. And post acceptance, the liquidation process must be concluded in 180 days. In case, the resolution plan is restored in place of liquidation, that process should conclude in 120 days (see chart).\n\nPanda said that the single biggest issue the Committee had to deal with was timelines.  \"The general consensus was that IBC is doing a great job – with respect to resolution and recoveries--but it is taking longer than envisaged for the process to conclude.\"\n\nClean-state principle\n\nThe other aspect that the Committee looked into was the \"clean-state principle\". Panda noted that the Committee has reiterated that it is a fundamental tenet of the IBC, and should not be violated by any entity – including government agencies.\n\nThe clean slate principle is a judicially recognized doctrine which ensures that once a company (Corporate Debtor) is successfully sold or revived through a resolution plan, the new owner starts with a completely \"fresh slate\". This means the new management cannot be burdened with any \"surprise liabilities\" or claims that originated before the takeover, but were not included in the final approved plan.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it has been seen that many claimants, including government agencies, keep seeking their due even after the resolution plan has been approved. The Supreme Court of India and other courts have ruled many times in favour of the clean slate principle…but we have seen it has not been followed,\" Panda noted.\n\n\"We have made an attempt to clarify this ambiguity in our suggestions,\" he said.\n\nOperational creditors\n\nOn the aspect of operational creditors not getting adequate dues from liquidation, the Member of the Parliament said that \"nowhere in the world there’s any special arrangement for operational creditors\".\n\n\"If they want their dues back. They have other avenues, such as SARFAESI Act or Debt Recovery Tribunals. It’s important to understand that long-term secured debt can’t be equated with unsecured business advances. When banks fund a project for a 10-15 year period, they take a certain risk. It’s aloan,it’s treated differently than a business advance – which OCs give,\" he explained.\n\n\"The Committee has not changed anything in the waterfall mechanism. The IBC has to do with insolvency and bankruptcy of the companies, and not with debt recovery. Debt recovery is happening as a by-product of the process. Primary purpose is resolution of the company, or else, liquidation,\" said Panda.", "company": "", "date": "January 14, 2026/ 17:08 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Priyansh Verma"}
{"title": "Why an emergency fund deserves a permanent place in your investment portfolio", "content": "Emergency funds don’t get much respect. They don’t grow fast. They don’t look impressive in spreadsheets. They sit quietly, doing nothing most of the time. That’s exactly why many people either underfund them or skip them altogether.\n\nThe mistake is treating an emergency fund as separate from investing, or worse, as a temporary phase you “graduate” from once income rises. In reality, an emergency fund is not a detour from wealth creation. It’s the foundation that allows the rest of the portfolio to work as intended.\n\nWhat emergencies actually look like in real life\n\nEmergencies are rarely dramatic one-off events. They arrive as job gaps that last longer than expected, medical expenses that insurance doesn’t fully cover, family responsibilities that can’t be postponed, or sudden repairs that don’t wait for market conditions to improve.\n\nThe problem isn’t just the expense. It’s timing. Emergencies show up when markets are down, bonuses are delayed, or cash flow is tight. That’s when people without an emergency buffer are forced into bad decisions.\n\nHow the absence of an emergency fund damages investments\n\nWithout an emergency fund, long-term investments become hostage to short-term needs. Equity investments get sold at the wrong time. SIPs are stopped just when they should continue. Retirement accounts are dipped into with penalties and regret.\n\nThese actions don’t just solve the immediate problem. They permanently reduce future wealth. What looks like a short-term fix quietly compounds into a long-term loss.\n\nAn emergency fund prevents your investment strategy from being dismantled under pressure.\n\nWhy credit is a poor substitute\n\nMany people assume they can rely on credit cards, personalloans,or overdrafts during emergencies. This feels reassuring until it’s needed.\n\nCredit is most available when you don’t need it and least available when you do. Job loss, medical issues, or income instability are exactly the situations where lenders become cautious. Even when credit is available, it often comes at a high cost.\n\nAn emergency fund doesn’t ask questions. It doesn’t charge interest. It doesn’t depend on approval.\n\nHow much is “enough” depends on stability, not rules\n\nThere’s no universal number that works for everyone. A single-income household with variable income needs a very different buffer from a dual-income household with stable jobs.\n\nThe right size of an emergency fund depends on how replaceable your income is, how predictable your expenses are, and how much support you can realistically rely on in a crisis.\n\nThe goal isn’t perfection. It’s resilience. Enough money to buy time and options.\n\nWhere an emergency fund should live\n\nEmergency funds should be boring and accessible. This is not money meant for growth. It’s money meant for availability.\n\nHigh-liquidity instruments like savings accounts, sweep-in deposits, or liquid funds are more appropriate than volatile or locked-in products. The return matters far less than certainty and speed.\n\nIf accessing the money requires market timing, paperwork, or penalties, it’s not doing its job.\n\nWhy high earners need emergency funds too\n\nRising income often creates a false sense of security. Higher salaries usually come with higher fixed commitments. EMIs, lifestyle costs, and responsibilities scale up quickly.\n\nThis means that even a short disruption can create disproportionate stress. High earners without emergency funds often feel the impact more sharply because their monthly obligations leave little room for error.\n\nAn emergency fund absorbs that shock quietly.\n\nWhen an emergency fund stops being optional\n\nThe moment you take on dependants, long-term liabilities, or irregular income, an emergency fund moves from “nice to have” to non-negotiable.\n\nIt’s also essential for anyone investing aggressively. The more volatility you accept in your portfolio, the more stability you need outside it.\n\nEmergency funds don’t compete with investments. They protect them.", "company": "", "date": "January 16, 2026/ 16:31 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

{"title": "Budget 2026: Will FM Nirmala Sitharaman scrap the old tax regime?", "content": "As Budget 2026 approaches, one question continues to surface among taxpayers: will the government finally scrap the old tax regime? With the new tax regime now the default option, and successive budgets steadily making it more attractive, discussions around the future of the old regime have only intensified.\n\nThe new tax regime offers lower slab rates, simpler compliance, and fewer exemptions. Over time, it has been positioned as the preferred system for India’s evolving tax base. Yet, despite this push, the old tax regime is still chosen by a meaningful section of taxpayers.\n\n“There is a significant proportion still about 28 to 29 percent, that is still well invested under the old regime,” said Nitin Bajal, Executive Director at Deloitte India. That number tells even as most taxpayers migrate to the new regime for its simplicity, a meaningful minority continues to find real tax savings under the old framework.\n\nThe old tax regime remains relevant for taxpayers who actively use deductions such as House Rent Allowance (HRA), Section 80C investments, health insurance premiums under Section 80D, educationloans,and home loan interest benefits. For higher-income salaried individuals with structured compensation, these deductions can materially reduce tax liability, something the new regime does not allow.\n\nFrom a policy standpoint, however, scrapping the old regime is not as straightforward as it may appear. Over decades, the Indian tax system has encouraged household savings through tax-linked instruments like provident funds, insurance, and housing. A sudden withdrawal of the old regime could disrupt long-term financial planning for millions who have committed to these products based on stable tax assumptions.\n\nTax experts also point to repeated assurances from the government that the old regime will continue to coexist. “Based on repeated statements and clarifications from the Finance Ministry, there has been a consistent assurance that the old tax regime will not be abolished. In line with these assurances, it is reasonable to expect that the option to continue under the old tax regime will remain available for individuals who prefer it, even if only a few percentages of individuals are still opting for it,” says Neeraj Agarwala, Partner, Nangia & Co LLP.\n\nThis continuity also helps the government manage the transition to a simpler tax system without alienating taxpayers who are midway through long-term commitments. From a political and administrative perspective, offering choice reduces resistance and builds trust.\n\nThat said, the government’s intent to gradually nudge taxpayers towards the new regime is clear. By making the new regime the default, expanding standard deductions, and improving slab structures, the incentive to voluntarily shift has increased. Over time, this could naturally shrink the relevance of the old regime without formally abolishing it.\n\nEven within the tax advisory community, the consensus is that Budget 2026 is unlikely to deliver a decisive break. “The old tax regime and new tax regime will continue to be available and the government may not phase out the old regime. We will have to wait for policy change and a clear signal for forecasting the scrapping of the old regime,” said Sudhakar Sethuraman, Partner, Deloitte India.\n\nFor now, the debate is less about whether the old regime will be scrapped and more about how long it will coexist alongside the new one.\n\nBudget 2026 is expected to reinforce the government’s preference for simplicity and compliance, but without pulling the plug on a system that still works for nearly a third of taxpayers. For individuals, the message remains unchanged: evaluate both regimes carefully, because choice, at least for now, seems here to stay.", "company": "", "date": "January 19, 2026/ 08:14 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Teena Jain Kaushal"}

The price of precious metal surged to an all-time high of $4,648 on January 14.\n\nOn MCX, the precious metal closed the January 15 session at Rs 1,43,120 for 10 grams after surging to its peak at Rs 1,43,333 during the evening trade. The price of gold peaked at Rs 1,43,590 on January 14.\n\nThe Augmont Bullion report, published on January 15, noted that gold pulled back from its record high of $4,650 after the US President Donald Trump refrained from announcing new tariffs on imports of critical minerals. Instead, Trump said the US would pursue negotiations with foreign nations to secure adequate supplies and quickly reduce supply-chain risks. That said, the White House left the door open to imposing import restrictions if talks fail to deliver timely results.\n\nSafe-haven demand also cooled after Trump said he had been assured that executions of protesters in Iran had stopped, easing fears of an imminent US military response.\n\nMarkets continue to assess how aggressively the Federal Reserve may ease policy amid global uncertainty. November producer price inflation — both headline and core — came in softer than expected, reinforcing signals from the benign December consumer inflation data. Together, these readings have strengthened expectations that the Fed has room to deliver multiple rate cuts this year, the report stated.\n\nGold prices vary by purity.\n\nCity-wise gold prices in India today\n\nGold rates across India’s major cities showed remarkable uniformity, with only marginal differences due to local taxes, jeweller margins, and logistics costs.\n\nOutlook: Will gold continue its momentum?\n\nRoss Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead, VT Markets, said, \"Gold’s medium-term outlook remains constructive, supported by a combination of macro uncertainty, strong central-bank buying, and expectations of lower real interest rates. While gold has traditionally been viewed as a safe-haven asset, recent market behavior shows it is also trading as a momentum asset, responding sharply to shifts in interest-rate expectations, the US dollar, and equity market volatility.\"\n\nHe predicts in this environment, gold could potentially move towards the $4,800–$5,000 over the next 12–18 months, especially if rate cuts materialise and geopolitical risks persist.\n\n\"That said, with prices already near record highs, investors should be mindful of short-term corrections driven by profit-taking or temporary risk-on sentiment. For long-term investors, gold still makes sense as a portfolio hedge and diversifier, but a staggered or phased investment approach may be more prudent than aggressive lump-sum buying at current levels.

{"title": "OPINIONTiger Global ruling enhances India’s ability to tax offshore assets deriving value here", "content": "S Vasudevan, Harshit Khurana and Giridhar Vasudevan\n\nIn a landmark ruling with far-reaching implications for foreign investors, the Supreme Court of India has denied capital gains tax exemption to Mauritius-based Tiger Global International Holdings, holding that the investor was not entitled to treaty benefits under the India-Mauritius Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (‘DTAA’).\n\nA shift in stance on perceived treaty abuse\n\nThe decision marks a significant shift in India’s approach to interpreting tax treaties in the post-GAAR world and signals a more assertive stance against perceived treaty abuse, conduit structures, and instances of double non-taxation.\n\nThe Court has held that post introduction of GAAR, Tax Residency Certificate (‘TRC’) alone no longer guarantees treaty benefits. It further ruled that indirect transfers are not protected under Article 13(4), diluted grandfathering for pre-2017 investments, and reinforced substance over form principles significantly impacting Mauritius and other tax haven structures and future cross border investments.\n\nControversy involved and the Supreme Court’s judgment\n\nTiger Global International Holdings (‘Taxpayer’), a Mauritius investment entity, had acquired shares between 2011 to 2015 in Flipkart’s Singapore entity, whose value was derived substantially from Flipkart India’s shares in India. The aforesaid shares were transferred in 2018 to a Luxembourg entity as part of Walmart’s broader acquisition. The taxpayer engaged Tiger Global Management, LLC, a group entity, for investment support functions.\n\nTaxpayer’s application for a nil‑withholding certificate under section 197 of the Income tax Act (‘the Act’) was rejected on the basis that it was allegedly not eligible for DTAA benefits due to lack of independent control. The AAR subsequently rejected the application, calling it to a case of prima facie tax‑avoidance arrangement. The taxpayer succeeded before the Delhi High Court, which quashed the AAR’s decision and held that the capital gains were not taxable in India owing to the grandfathering protection under Article 13(3A) of the DTAA.\n\nThe question before the Supreme Court was whether the transfer of shares held by the taxpayer in Flipkart Singapore is taxable in India under the Act read with DTAA.\n\nIndirect transfers not covered by treaty protection\n\nA central element of the ruling is the Court’s interpretation of Article 13(4) of the India-Mauritius DTAA. The Court held that this provision, which assigns taxing rights to the state of residence for gains not covered in earlier paragraphs, applies only where the Mauritian resident directly holds the property or shares being sold.\n\nIn Tiger Global’s case, since the sale involved shares of a Singapore holding company which was deriving its value substantially from assets in India, the transaction constituted an indirect transfer. According to the Court, the same is outside the treaty protection provided in Article 13(4). As a result, India retains the right to tax such gains in accordance with its domestic laws.\n\nThis marks a departure from the Andhra Pradesh High Court’s ruling in Sanofi Pasteur2, which had interpreted similar treaty language to include indirect transfers.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s interpretation significantly narrows treaty protection for multitiered structures and strengthens India’s ability to tax offshore transfers of assets deriving value from India.\n\nGrandfathering diluted under Rule 10U of the Income Tax Rules (the Rules)\n\nRule 10U(1)(d) grandfathers capital gains from shares acquired before 1 April 2017. However, the Court relying on the provisions of Rule 10U(2) held that this grandfathering does not immunize transactions from General Anti Abuse Rules (GAAR) if the tax benefit from arrangement occurs post-2017.\n\nAlthough Tiger Global had acquired shares prior to 2017, the sale transaction occurred in 2018. The Court held that because Rule 10U(2) is expressly made applicable to any arrangement, irrespective of the date on which it was entered, GAAR can still apply to investments made before April’ 2017 if the tax benefits are obtained post the said date.\n\nThis reasoning significantly expands the applicability of GAAR to long-standing investment structures that were previously considered shielded from anti-avoidance challenges.\n\nTRC not sufficient to prove residency or treaty entitlement\n\nThe Court held unambiguously that a Tax Residency Certificate is not conclusive evidence of residency or treaty eligibility. Section 90(4) treats TRC as a minimum requirement but not a decisive one. Even upon production of TRC, authorities are free to independently examine the residential status.\n\nEarlier circulars cannot override statutory amendments\n\nThe Court held that CBDT Circular 789, which had earlier stated that TRC is a sufficient proof of residency, cannot apply in the current legal regime shaped by GAAR and subsequent amendments. Circulars operate only within the legislative context in which they were issued and cannot override statutory changes. This observation weakens taxpayers’ reliance on administrative guidance issued before GAAR’s introduction.\n\nGAAR applies and burden of proof lies on the taxpayer\n\nSection 96(2) presumes that an arrangement resulting in a tax benefit is an impermissible avoidance arrangement unless the taxpayer proves otherwise. The Court concluded that Tiger Global failed to discharge this burden. The Court emphasized that the primary purpose of the arrangement appeared to be tax avoidance, and the taxpayer did not furnish sufficient evidence of commercial justification.\n\nJudicial anti-abuse doctrines (JAAR) still apply\n\nEven if GAAR were held inapplicable, the Court stated that judicial anti-abuse principles such as substance over form, transparency and the prohibition on conduit structures remain available to interpret treaties. Citing McDowell3 and Vodafone4, the Court reaffirmed that judicial anti-avoidance rules coexist with GAAR and may independently support the denial of treaty benefits.\n\nDouble nontaxation treated as a red flag\n\nThe Court held that Tiger Global’s argument that the gains were exempt in Mauritius strengthened the tax authority’s case. According to the Court, a tax structure that results in double non-taxation undermines the object of the DTAA and indicates an impermissible avoidance arrangement.\n\nObservation on tax sovereignty\n\nThe Court also emphasized that the right to tax income arising within India is an essential attribute of sovereignty. The Court has stressed the need for renegotiation of treaties, insert robust exit clauses and safeguards against base erosion.\n\nImpact Analysis of Judgment\n\nThe ruling marks a significant departure from the well-established approach as laid out in Azadi Bachao Andolan. The Court’s reasoning acknowledges that the global tax environment has shifted dramatically, with BEPS principles and substance requirements now at the forefront. Investors can no longer rely merely on formal documentation like TRCs. They must also demonstrate genuine operational and economic presence in the treaty jurisdiction.\n\nThe Court has elevated the threshold for establishing tax residency and treaty entitlement. Substance must be demonstrated through credible evidence of independent decision-making powers, board level control exercised in Mauritius, meaningful operations, and genuine tax liability in the jurisdiction of residence. Entities that primarily rely on offshore advisory entities may face enhanced scrutiny.\n\nThe Court’s observation that double non-taxation may indicate avoidance has profound implications. Many international structures rely on legitimate exemptions granted by the residence jurisdiction. By treating double non-taxation as condition to access beneficial provisions of a tax treaty, the ruling may introduce uncertainty for global funds.\n\nThe Court’s interpretation of Rule 10U reduces the comfort previously enjoyed by investors with pre2017 holdings. GAAR can now apply even to historical investments if the exit occurs post2017. This has implications for private equity exits, long-term FDI structures, and multilayered global holding arrangements.\n\nThe dilution of circulars, broad application of GAAR, and importance placed on substance tests increase discretionary powers of tax authorities. In the absence of detailed guidelines as to application of GAAR by the tax authorities, inconsistencies in application are expected.\n\nWhile the judgment widens India’s tax base, it also signals a new era of heightened scrutiny. Investors may now need to rethink long-standing governance models, reevaluate multijurisdictional holding structures, and maintain far more rigorous documentation to withstand GAAR-driven assessments.\n\nAs the traditional comfort of Mauritius structures diminishes, global investors investing in India may increasingly look in increasing substance to their investment structures to justify incidental tax benefits arising out of the arrangements.\n\n(S Vasudevan is Executive Partner, Harshit Khurana, Associate Partner and Giridhar Vasudevan, Principal Associate at Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan Attorneys. Views are personal and do not represent the stand of Moneycontrol.)", "company": "", "date": "January 17, 2026/ 19:17 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol News"}

{"title": "How staying on the wrong home loan rate quietly increases costs", "content": "For years, home loan interest rates were something borrowers set and forgot. You picked a lender, signed the papers, and assumed the rate would broadly take care of itself. That assumption turned out to be expensive.\n\nAs interest rates moved sharply over the last few years, a large number of borrowers discover they are paying far more than they need to. Not because rates went up, but because they are sitting on the wrong kind of rate structure and never question it.\n\nWhere things quietly go wrong\n\nThe biggest mistake isn’t taking a home loan when rates are low. That part makes sense. The problem is staying on rates that stop reflecting reality.\n\nMany borrowers remain on older base rate or MCLR-linkedloanslong after banks shift to external benchmark-linked rates. On paper, the difference looks small. In practice, it compounds month after month.\n\nOthers choose fixed-rate loans believing they are buying certainty. What they often bring instead is rigidity. When rates start falling or reset structures changed, fixed-rate borrowers find themselves locked into higher costs with limited exit options.\n\nWhy the impact feels invisible at first\n\nHome loans are long-term by design. A few thousand rupees extra every month doesn’t feel alarming when spread over decades. The EMI still gets paid. Life moves on.\n\nThe real cost shows up over time. Higher interest means slower principal repayment. That keeps the outstanding loan larger for longer, which in turn increases total interest paid over the life of the loan.\n\nBy the time many borrowers realise this, years have already passed.\n\nThe fixed versus floating misunderstanding\n\nFixed-rate loans are often sold as peace of mind. The pitch is simple. No surprises. Stable EMIs.\n\nWhat is less emphasised is how limited “fixed” often is. Many so-called fixed-rate home loans are only fixed for a short initial period. After that, they reset at rates that may no longer be competitive.\n\nFloating-rate borrowers face their own issues. Those on older benchmarks don’t see rate cuts flow through properly, while hikes are passed on quickly. The structure matters more than borrowers realise.\n\nWhy banks have little incentive to correct this for you\n\nBanks are not required to proactively move borrowers to cheaper benchmarks. If you don’t ask, nothing changes.\n\nFrom the bank’s perspective, an old loan paying a higher rate isn’t a problem. It becomes a problem only when the borrower pushes back, asks for a reset, or threatens to move.\n\nMany borrowers simply didn’t know they could do that.\n\nWhat you should check immediately\n\nThe first thing to look at is what your loan is linked to. If it’s not linked to an external benchmark like the repo rate, you may already be overpaying.\n\nThe second thing is your spread. Even among repo-linked loans, the spread over the benchmark varies. Two borrowers with the same bank and similar profiles can be paying different rates.\n\nFinally, look at how much of your EMI is going towards principal today compared to a few years ago. If progress feels painfully slow, interest is doing more damage than you think.\n\nWhat you can still do now\n\nThe most straightforward fix is a rate reset. Many banks allow borrowers to switch to a lower rate for a fee. It’s not pleasant to pay a fee, but it can be worth it if it lowers your rate meaningfully.\n\nAnother option is refinancing. Moving the loan to another lender can reset the rate structure entirely. This takes effort and paperwork, but for large outstanding balances, the savings can be substantial.\n\nPrepayments also matter more than people realise. Even small, regular prepayments directly reduce the principal and cut interest outgo over the long term.\n\nThe bigger lesson borrowers are learning late\n\nHome loans reward attention, not loyalty. The best rate is rarely permanent. It has to be defended.\n\nBorrowers who reviewed their loans periodically, questioned rate changes, and acted when needed paid far less over time. Those who assumed things would adjust automatically ended up subsidising that comfort.\n\nThe mistake wasn’t choosing a home loan. It was choosing it once and never choosing again.", "company": "", "date": "January 16, 2026/ 17:31 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Moneycontrol PF Team"}

{"title": "MC EXCLUSIVE'Insolvency is of a company, not a real-estate project': Baijayant Panda rejects project-wise codification in IBC", "content": "The concept of project wise insolvency is contradictory to the principles of the IBC, Baijayant Panda, chairperson of the Parliament’s Select Committee on IBC told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview.\n\n\"This issue was debated at length in the Committee. You can have project wise resolution, but how can you have insolvency of a project. Insolvency will be of a company only,\" Panda said.\n\nHe explains that sometimes, the real estate companies take money from homebuyers and use it for other purpose, rather than completing the project. “Now if they don’t build the flats, the company goes into insolvency, which means, a new promoter comes and replaces the promoter.”\n\n“The whole concept of project wise insolvency goes against the fundamental tenets of IBC. IBC means the promoter has to go out. In the DNA of IBC, the promoters are not allowed to participate in the resolution, either directly or indirectly,” said the Member of the Parliament.\n\nOn the backlog of cases in NCLT, Panda noted that it’s being addressed, \"...the government is working on increasing the strength of benches and improve infrastructure of courts to clear backlogs of cases. But we must understand that the single largest source of backlog is real-estate cases, and that too, which are pre-RERA. After RERA, real-estate cases are not piling up.\"\n\n\"The backlog is a legacy issue, a one-time issue. The Committee has said that any new real-estate cases, should first be resolved by RERA, and if not, then they should come to IBC,\" said Panda\n\nQ. What are the key changes in the IBC Amendment Bill?\n\nThe Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was first enacted in 2016. In these past 10 years, it has had a revolutionary impact. 10 years back, banks were in a mess due to high non-performing assets (NPAs). Today they are among the healthiest in the world, and one major reason for that is IBC.\n\nPeople should remember that before IBC, companies which were doing badly lingered on for decades. But because of IBC, there have been vast number of resolutions, and some liquidations. One figure astonishes me, in the last 3-4 years, on an annual basis, about Rs 50,000-60,000 crore is being recovered by banks from stressed assets. This is a very significant number. Despite this, it was felt that IBC should be further improved.\n\nOne key focus of these reforms was to enforce strict timelines, as the resolution were taking longer than 330-day period. This is a major overhaul. It’s like a reboot. GST was recently rebooted, and we saw the results on consumption.\n\nThe timelines have become very strictly spelled in the Amendment Bill. This will dramatically reduce the time for resolution, and the recovery will also go up dramatically. Rs 50,000-60,000 crore is a good number, but it may also double.\n\nRegarding other aspects, the new Bill makes resolution of MSMES much easier. Small companies don’t have the wherewithal to deal with IBC. For MSME, a pre-packaged resolution plan has been envisaged. The bar has been lowered for initiation of the pre-packaged process. Now 51 percent votes of the financial creditors are required for the process to start, earlier it was 66 percent.\n\nAnother big change is, if there is no resolution, the resolution professional (RP) should be changed. If resolution can’t happen, a fresh RP should be appointed for liquidation. The idea should be that the company should be saved. Liquidation is a fairly straightforward process. The RP should have no focus on liquidation.\n\nAlso, the new code introduces cross border insolvency and group insolvency norms. This was a major gap in our insolvency ecosystem, which doesn’t exist anymore.\n\nQ. Operational creditors say that they don’t get adequate dues in liquidation. The new Bill, however, doesn’t address their concerns. The Select Committee made recommendation of distribution waterfall, but said nothing on OCs...\n\nA. We have not changed anything in the waterfall mechanism, we have only codified what had already become the norm because of earlier amendments and court rulings (government dues getting lower priority).\n\nRegarding OCs, nowhere in the world, there is a special arrangement for them. The IBC has to do with insolvency and bankruptcy of the companies, and not with debt recovery. Debt recovery is happening as a by-product of the process. The primary purpose of the law is resolution of the company, or else, liquidation.\n\nOCs, however, do have other avenues. They have debt-recovery tribunals (DBTs), and the SARFAESI Act.\n\nIt’s important to understand this. There is a significant difference between long-term securedloans,and unsecured business advances. When banks fund a project for a 10-15-year period, they take a certain risk. It’s a loan, it’s treated differently than a business advance. On the other hand, when an OC supplies some equipment or materials to the company, it’s an advance…they fully understand that the status of the company. If the company is already defaulting, OCs wont supply. So, in basis principle, you can’t equate long-term secured debt with short-term unsecured advance.\n\nQ. The Select Committee has suggested a 3-month timeline for NCLAT to decide on IBC appeals. Despite the timelines being imposed, can resolution time reduce if the strength of the benches is low?\n\nA. It’s being addressed. The draft bill which came to us already has provisions for rigid timelines, with respect to phases of resolution plan. At the appellate level, there was no timeline. That has been recommended by the Select Committee.\n\nSeparately, the government is working on increasing the strength of benches and improve infrastructure of courts to clear backlogs of cases. But we must understand that the single largest source of backlog is real-estate cases, and that too, which are pre-RERA. After RERA, real-estate cases are not piling up.\n\nThe backlog is a legacy issue, a one-time issue. The Committee has said that any new real-estate cases, should first be resolved by RERA, and if not, then they should come to IBC.\n\nQ. Is there a case in your view for project wise insolvency to be codified in the IBC statute?\n\nA. This issue was debated at length in the Committee. The concept of project wise insolvency is a contradiction in terms. When we talk about IBC, we are talking about company. You can have project wise resolution, but how can you have insolvency of a project. Insolvency will be of a company only. There have been some court orders on this as well.\n\nImagine, there is a real estate company, and they have projects all over the country. The company is doing well, but one project has gone bad. The people want the flats, or the refund. They don’t bother about resolution of the company.\n\nSometimes, what happens, the real estate companies take money from homebuyers and use it for other purpose, rather than completing the project. Now if they don’t build the flats, the company goes into insolvency, which means, a new promoter comes and replaces the promoter.\n\nThe whole concept of project wise insolvency goes against the fundamental tenets of IBC. IBC means the promoter has to go out. In the DNA of IBC, the promoters are not allowed to participate in the resolution, either directly or indirectly. IBC has the put the fear of god into promoters. If the company doesn’t go out of their hand, why will they co-operate?\n\nQ. Have all recommendations of the Select Committee been accepted?\n\nA. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs will take our report, and discuss it internally and the Cabinet. We hope most of the recommendations will be accepted.\n\nThe single biggest one was timelines. The general consensus was, IBC is doing a great job, but it is taking longer than envisaged. You may complete in so and so time, now, shall is added.\n\nAnother main issue which came coming up is the clean state principle. When the company goes bankrupt, new promoter comes, who pays the dues.\n\nYour debts maybe X, but this company is only viable at X minus some percent, for the new promoter. Once the resolution process is complete, the resolution plan is approved, this is what the new promoter should be liable for.\n\nUnfortunately, it was seen, that many claimants keep seeking their due even after the resolution plan was approved, including government agencies. The Supreme Court has ruled in favour of clean state principle, but it was not being followed.\n\nThe Bill has made it amply clear.\n\nQ. The Select Committee’s press release said clean state principle to apply on a “retrospective” basis, which some stakeholders are interpreting as a new addition in the law…\n\nA. This principal of clean state has existed right from 2016 only, when the Principal law was enacted. We’re only reiterating. We have seen evidence of people violating the clean state principal, so we made it clear, that this principal exists in law, for clarity. The \"retrospective\" term is not any new addition. The Supreme Court has ruled in many cases that clean slate principal applies in IBC, so how can retrospective be a new addition.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 07:58 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Priyansh Verma"}
{"title": "MC EXCLUSIVETax department issues notices to 4–5 foreign digital firms over permanent establishment", "content": "The tax department has issued notices to as many as five large foreign digital companies, saying their activities in India meet the threshold of a permanent establishment (PE), sources aware of the development said.\n\nThese companies are preparing to contest the assessments, challenging them at the assessing officer level or before the Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP).\n\n“Four to five large foreign digital companies have already received tax notices that their Indian operations are a permanent establishment. In some cases, assessments have already treated them as PE,” one of the sources cited above told Moneycontrol.\n\nA permanent establishment refers to a fixed place of business through which a foreign company conducts its business in another country.\n\nUnder tax law and treaties, once a company is classified as having a permanent establishment in India, it is treated as having a taxable presence in the country. Indian tax authorities can attribute a portion of the company’s India-linked income to that establishment, deduct related expenses and tax the resulting profit.\n\nTesting the PE boundary\n\nAt the core of the dispute is how broadly the concept of permanent establishment is interpreted in the digital economy.\n\nTax authorities are examining whether certain digital, operational or technical arrangements — even without a conventional office — are sufficient to create a taxable presence.\n\n“The demand depends entirely on how the PE is calculated. Once that is decided, income attribution follows,” the person said.\n\nThe final liability depends on how much income is attributed to the PE; 35 percent is the standard corporate tax rate applied to foreign companies.\n\n“It is theoretically revenue minus expenses but in practice, it is exceedingly complex. Every assumption is contested,” the person said.\n\nDigital companies push back\n\nThe companies argue that they have only a “communication set-up which is not even owned by them”, which does not automatically create a PE.\n\n“They are saying their digital Indian operations do not amount to a PE. Accepting that would fundamentally change their tax position,” the person said.\n\nThe companies have approached the tax department and are expected to begin litigation at the assessment or DRP stage. Once a matter enters a judicial process, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) typically does not intervene administratively.\n\nGovernment explores presumptive tax route\n\nThe complexity of PE-based profit attribution has led the government to explore alternative models.\n\nAn internal report has proposed moving to a presumptive tax system for digital companies, where tax is calculated as a fixed percentage of revenue rather than through detailed profit calculations.\n\n“MeitY is trying to push a presumptive tax approach. They did something similar for electronic companies earlier,” the person said. Such a system would reduce disputes over cost allocation and margins.\n\nForeign digital firms, however, are resisting this approach. “From their perspective, agreeing to presumptive tax is like accepting that they have a PE in India. That is what they are trying to avoid,” the person said.\n\nOfficials and companies expect prolonged litigation. With high-value assessments and unresolved questions about how PE should apply in the digital economy, the cases are likely to move through multiple layers of appeal.\n\n“This is the first real test of how India will apply the PE concept to digital businesses. Whatever happens here will set the tone for future cases,” the person said.", "company": "", "date": "January 15, 2026/ 15:35 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Meghna Mittal"}
{"title": "Gold to silver ratio slides from 110 to 65 in 2025 amid steep rise in white metal prices. Should you continue buying base metals?", "content": "Precious metals had an excellent run-up in 2025, with silver rising nearly 170 percent far outperforming gold’s historic 76 percent rise. The gold-silver ratio also shows a decline from 110 to the recent low of 65, indicating that the white metal rose far faster than gold, as per the MOFSL Commodities Review 2025 and Preview 2026 report.\n\nThe falling ratio also signalled a tightening physical supply of precious metals, with gold staying constrained with limited mine expansion and scrap supply proving relatively inelastic even at elevated prices, while silver experienced periods of rare backwardation, signalling acute physical tightness during the year.\n\nWhile silver benefited from dual advantage in 2025- from robust industrial demand linked to the energy transition, solar installations, electrification, and technology investments- gold cashed in on safe-haven flows amid geopolitical and policy uncertainty.\n\n“The performance of precious metals in 2025 reflects a clear shift in investor behaviour. Gold has evolved beyond a cyclical hedge into a strategic reserve asset, supported by sustained central-bank buying, currency volatility, and persistent macro uncertainty,” said Manav Modi, Analyst (Commodities), Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.\n\nThere is also an unprecedented surge of domestic gold and silver ETFs, with the asset under management (AUM) registering a rise of more than 150 percent in 2025. The ETF flows turned decisively positive in the second half of the year, signalling renewed investor participation after a prolonged phase of outflows.\n\nThe report stated that the financial participation played a critical role in reinforcing commodity price trends during 2025. Currency movements added further support, with a weaker dollar index and a depreciating rupee enhancing domestic commodity returns.\n\nBase metals: copper takes the lead\n\nCopper also saw a historic rise in prices to nearly $13,000 per tonne, representing a 40 percent year-on-year gain in 2025. Global refined copper demand is forecast to rise by more than 2.1 percent to 28.7 million tonnes in 2026.\n\nDuring the period, aluminium and zinc gained 17 percent and 5 percent, respectively. The report predicts that base metals may see phases of consolidation, offering selective medium-term opportunities, while energy markets are expected to remain sensitive to supply-demand adjustments.\n\n“While base metals and energy markets reflected divergent fundamentals in 2025, structural demand drivers, particularly electrification and infrastructure, continue to underpin select metals, creating opportunities during periods of consolidation,” said Navneet Damani, Head of Research (Commodities), MOFSL.\n\nRead more:Copper prices jump nearly 60% in a year: How can retail investors participate?\n\nGold and Silver Outlook\n\nThe report predicts that gold and silver will retain their strategic relevance in early 2026, supported by continued central-bank and investor demand, limited mine supply growth, and relatively inelastic scrap flows. Physical market tightness is therefore expected to persist, reinforcing precious metals as long-term portfolio anchors.\n\nLooking ahead, the report’s outlook suggests consolidation rather than reversal, meaning that the price movement of precious metals is expected to pause or move sideways, and not fall sharply, as investors are increasingly viewing gold and silver as strategic assets. It cautions investors that the ride in 2026 may not be as smooth as in 2025. So, continue to maintain a buy on dips stance for both gold and silver.\n\n“As we move into 2026, commodities are transitioning from momentum-driven trades to strategically allocated assets. While volatility is likely to remain a feature of the market, structural demand, currency dynamics, and policy uncertainty continue to reinforce the role of commodities—particularly precious metals—as core portfolio hedges in an increasingly fragmented global macro environment,” the report stated.", "company": "", "date": "January 12, 2026/ 16:52 IST", "category": "business", "author": "Dipen Pradhan"}
