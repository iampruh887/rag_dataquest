  "content": "Major brokerages expect large steelmakers to report weaker quarter-on-quarter performance in October–December 2025 (Q3 FY26), with lower realisations and softer EBITDA per tonne, as steel prices stayed sluggish for most of the quarter.\n\nAnalysts say one reason was a gap in import protection. The first phase of the safeguard duty on certain imported steel grades, announced in April 2025, expired in the first week of November, and its absence for part of the quarter reduced the competitiveness of domestic steel versus cheaper imports. The government later renewed the safeguard duty regime on December 30, 2025, extending it till April 2028.\n\nMargins were also squeezed by higher global spot prices for coking coal, a key input that many Indian steelmakers import. This pressure persisted despite lower iron ore costs and better operating leverage, which otherwise could have cushioned profitability.\n\n\"We expect margins to sequentially decrease around Rs 1,530 per tonne on average in Q3 for steel companies, mainly led by lower steel prices. The benefits of operating leverage and lower iron ore prices were partially offset by higher coking coal costs,\" said Amarjeet Maurya, deputy vice president, fundamental research, Kotak Securities.\n\nOn steel prices for the quarter, Maurya added, \"We expect an average decrease in steel realisations of around Rs 2,060 per tonne quarter-on-quarter across our steel coverage; while prices of both long and flat products decreased in the quarter, the decline was more prominent in flat products, given the absence of safeguard duty during most parts of November/December 2025\".\n\nAccording to earnings estimates by brokerage firms, most major steelmakers, such asJSW Steel,Tata Steel,Jindal Steel, andSteel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL), are expected to report flatness or declines in margins and realisations. The public sector utility SAIL is expected to fare worse than the others in profitability due to price declines, as well as no new capacities being on-streamed, said a report from Systematix Institutional Equities.\n\nStrong sales volumes are expected to slightly mitigate the losses for the large steel mills, with domestic deliveries by most firms growing both annually and quarter-on-quarter for the October-December quarter. Elara Securities estimated that of the firms in its coverage, sequential volumes are expected to grow 7 percent, while the same year-on-year is seen at around 13 percent.\n\nJindal Stainlessis set to post 11 percent year-on-year volume growth, alongside a 2 percent year-on-year improvement in EBITDA per tonne, Elara noted in a quarterly preview. However, the firm's consolidated EBITDA is expected to decline by around 0.8 percent over the July-September quarter.",
