  "content": "The BJP-led alliance at the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is set to take charge of a civic budget that has expanded rapidly in size, but where the relative importance of key social and urban services has steadily diminished, a Moneycontrol analysis shows.\n\nAs of 17:30, the BJP-led alliance was leading in 120 of the 227 BMC seats, with the BJP itself ahead in 93.\n\nThe political transition comes against the backdrop of a striking fiscal transformation at India’s richest civic body. BMC’s total expenditure has more than doubled in just four years, rising from Rs 35,962 crore in FY22 to Rs 74,367 crore in FY26. Much of this expansion has been driven by an aggressive push on capital expenditure, which now accounts for close to 60 percent of total spendin, among the highest ratios for any urban local body in the country.\n\nA similar pattern is visible in storm water drainage, a critical function for a city repeatedly hit by monsoon flooding. Spending on drains rose from Rs 2,050 crore in FY22 to Rs 3,039 crore in FY26. Yet its share in total expenditure slipped from 5.7 percent to a little over 4 percent, suggesting that flood-mitigation spending has not kept pace with the overall scale-up in civic outlays.\n\nPrimary education has also seen a steady decline in budgetary weight. Allocations increased from Rs 2,966 crore in FY22 to Rs 3,956 crore in FY26, but the sector’s share in total spending dropped sharply—from 8.25 percent to 5.32 percent over the same period. The trend points to a gradual deprioritisation of municipal schooling, even as issues of enrolment, quality and infrastructure remain unresolved.\n\nNot all service heads show the same dilution. Spending on solid waste management, slum development and sanitation has been relatively more stable. Outlays in this broad category nearly doubled from Rs 3,247 crore in FY22 to Rs 6,065 crore in FY26, with its share largely hovering around 8–9 percent through most of the period, dipping in FY25 before a marginal recovery in FY26.\n\nFor the incoming BJP-led alliance, the data underline a central policy challenge. With revenue growth slowing and large capital commitments already locked in, the new dispensation will need to reconcile infrastructure ambitions with the task of arresting the steady dilution of core social and civic services.",
