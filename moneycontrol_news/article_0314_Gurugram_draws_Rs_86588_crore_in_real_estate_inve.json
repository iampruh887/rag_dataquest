Of the total units approved, 31,455 were residential, reflecting sustained end-user demand as well as investor confidence in Gurugram’s long-term housing fundamentals.\n\n“The residential mix was spread across categories, with 17,405 group housing units, 5,720 mixed land use units, 4,040 residential floor units, 2,122 affordable group housing units, 1,954 units under the Deen Dayal housing scheme, and 214 residential plotted colony units,” the Authority data showed.\n\nMarket observers said this diversified pipeline indicates that capital is being deployed across both premium and mass segments, reducing concentration risk and improving the depth of the market.\n\nAuthority officials said that of the 4,000 commercial units approved during the year, 168 units were dedicated to IT parks, reinforcing Gurugram’s status as a preferred destination for technology firms and Global Capability Centres.\n\nAnalysts said the combination of office-led employment growth and residential development continues to make Gurugram attractive for long-term capital deployment.\n\nIndustry experts said that the scale of investments approved in 2025 reflects Gurugram’s ability to attract capital even amid global uncertainty, driven by infrastructure expansion, strong corporate presence, and a more robust regulatory framework.\n\n“With a large pipeline of approved projects and continued interest from developers and institutional investors, Gurugram is expected to remain a key investment destination within India’s real estate market in the coming years,” a Gurugram-based real estate expert said.\n\nTighter regulatory checks\n\nAuthority officials said that alongside rising investment volumes, Gurugram RERA implemented tighter regulatory checks to improve transparency and protect investor and homebuyer interests.\n\n“These steps included enhanced scrutiny of developer submissions, mandatory site inspections by domain experts, and the introduction of public consultation through mandatory public notices before project registration,” an official said.\n\nAmlan Dutta, VP Sales and Strategy, Trehan Iris, said, that Gurugram’s clearance of 131 projects in 2025 marks a remarkable momentum for the sector, reflecting strong investor confidence and a renewed sense of market optimism.\n\n“RERA’s transparent and well-structured framework has played a pivotal role in driving this growth by empowering developers with greater planning certainty, smoother access to capital and the confidence to deliver high-quality projects on time. By promoting accountability and minimizing ambiguity, RERA safeguards buyer interests while simultaneously enhancing developer credibility,” he said.\n\nSudeep Bhatt, Director Strategy, Whiteland Corporation, said that regulatory reforms under RERA have been a key stimulus, bringing in greater transparency through strict compliance norms, mandatory site inspections and continuous project monitoring.\n\n“This has strengthened trust among HNIs and NRIs, leading to growing NRI participation and rising Indian global clout in real estate investments,” he said.",
