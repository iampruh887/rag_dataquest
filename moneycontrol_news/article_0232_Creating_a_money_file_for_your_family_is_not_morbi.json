  "content": "Most people organise their money for themselves, not for the people who may need to step in one day. Passwords are remembered, not written down. Insurance details are “somewhere in email”. Nominees are assumed to be updated. Bank accounts are known only vaguely.\n\nThis works fine as long as nothing goes wrong. The moment something does, families are left guessing. Not just about money, but about where to even begin. A simple “money file” exists to prevent that confusion.\n\nWhat a money file is actually meant to do\n\nA money file is not a balance sheet and not a will. It’s a guide. It tells your family what exists, where it exists, and how to access information when you’re not around to explain it.\n\nThe aim is clarity, not control. You’re not handing over money. You’re handing over a map.\n\nPeople often imagine this as a complex exercise. It isn’t. It’s just writing things down in a way that someone else can understand without calling ten people.\n\nPasswords are the hardest, and the most sensitive part\n\nPasswords are where most people freeze. They worry about security, misuse, or things falling into the wrong hands. Those concerns are valid.\n\nThe mistake is thinking the choice is between secrecy and chaos.\n\nYou don’t need to write down every password in plain text. What you do need is a way for your family to know how access works. That could mean storing passwords in a reputable password manager and sharing how to access it. Or noting where digital access is stored, rather than the credentials themselves.\n\nWhat matters is that your family isn’t locked out of bank accounts, email, or investment platforms at the exact moment they need them most.\n\nNominees are not paperwork you can ignore\n\nMany people assume nominees are already in place. Often they aren’t. Or they were set years ago and never updated.\n\nA money file should clearly list every account and who the nominee is for each one. Bank accounts, mutual funds, DEMAT accounts, insurance policies, provident fund. All of them.\n\nThis matters because nominees are the first point of contact for institutions. Missing or outdated nominations don’t just slow things down. They create legal and administrative hurdles at an already stressful time.\n\nInsurance details need to be obvious, not buried\n\nInsurance is one of the most important parts of a money file, and also the most poorly organised.\n\nFamilies often know there is insurance, but not which company, what kind, or how to claim it. Policy documents are scattered across inboxes and apps.\n\nA good money file clearly states what insurance exists, where the policy is held, the policy number, and how claims are initiated. Health insurance, life insurance, accidental cover, everything.\n\nThe difference between knowing and not knowing this information can be the difference between timely support and months of delay.\n\nWhat to store digitally, and what to keep offline\n\nNot everything belongs in one place. Sensitive information like access instructions works best in a secure digital format that can be updated easily. But it should be backed by something physical that tells your family where to look.\n\nA simple offline note saying where digital records are stored, who to contact, and what to prioritise can be invaluable. It doesn’t need numbers or passwords. It needs direction.\n\nThe biggest mistake is storing everything only in your head.\n\nHow detailed this really needs to be\n\nThis doesn’t need to be perfect. It needs to be usable. Your family doesn’t need your entire financial philosophy. They need to know which accounts exist, which are active, which are long-term, and who can help if they’re stuck. That could be a trusted friend, a financial adviser, or even a specific bank relationship manager.\n\nThe file should be written for someone who doesn’t deal with money the way you do.\n\nWhy this is an act of care, not pessimism\n\nPeople avoid this exercise because it feels uncomfortable. As if preparing for uncertainty somehow invites it.\n\nIn reality, a money file is no different from writing down emergency contacts or medical history. It’s about reducing stress for people you care about.\n\nYou don’t create it because something will happen. You create it so that if it does, your family isn’t left guessing in the dark.",
