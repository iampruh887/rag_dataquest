  "content": "Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut claimed on Sunday that many newly elected Shiv Sena corporators, who originally belonged to the Bal Thackery-founded party before its division, do not want a BJP mayor in Mumbai.\n\nAs the mayoral race heats up in Mumbai after the BMC polls, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, who heads the Shiv Sena, has moved his 29 corporators to a luxury hotel in the city.The Shiv Sena said its corporators have been put up at the hotel for a three-day workshop where Shinde will guide them on the functioning of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).\n\nWhen asked whether there will be a ’ghar wapsi’ (return) of corporators, Raut said, ”Many new corporators are originally Shiv Sainiks (of undivided Shiv Sena). Our understanding is everyone wants that a BJP mayor not be elected.” Even Shinde does not want a BJP mayor in Mumbai, Raut claimed.He said if the corporators are locked up in the hotel, there are different sources of communication to send and receive messages.\n\nThe corporators who have been locked up should be released, the Shiv Sena (UBT) leader added.Shiv Sena leader Sheetal Mhatre said her party and the BJP contested polls as Mahayuti.She said 20 of the 29 corporators have won for the first time and need to know how the BMC functions.”We don’t need to resort to hotel politics.\n\nThe elected corporators have defeated Shiv Sena (UBT) candidates,” Mhatre said.She also rejected the charge that the corporators were corralled into a hotel for better bargaining of posts in the BMC.On Saturday, Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray had said his party could have its mayor if ”Dev” (God) was willing. He also suggested that Shinde’s party was scared of poaching attempts by its ally BJP.”\n\nThere were discussions between Uddhav Thackeray and MNS president Raj Thackeray (on the post of mayor). We are watching it neutrally. There are many things happening behind the curtains,” Raut said.In the recently concluded civic polls, the alliance of the BJP and Shinde-led Sena won a clear majority in the 227-member BMC, securing 89 and 29 seats, respectively. The Sena (UBT) won 65 seats, while its ally MNS emerged victorious on six.",
