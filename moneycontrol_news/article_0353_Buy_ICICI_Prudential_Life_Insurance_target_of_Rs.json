For 9MFY26, VNB grew 6% YoY to INR16.6b, reflecting an improvement in VNB margin to 24.4% (22.8% in 9MFY25). PAT grew 19% YoY to INR3.9b (21% beat) in 3QFY26 (23% YoY growth for 9MFY26). Management indicated that GST reforms should be value-accretive for all stakeholders, including distributors. Partner-specific negotiations are underway to ensure VNB neutrality while maintaining distributor economics.\n\nWe have maintained our APE growth estimates for FY26-28. However, we have raised VNB margin assumption by 50bp/50bp/100bp for FY26/27/28, considering the 3QFY26 performance. We maintain our BUY rating with a TP of INR800 (based on 1.7x FY28E EV).\n\nFor all recommendations report,click here\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
