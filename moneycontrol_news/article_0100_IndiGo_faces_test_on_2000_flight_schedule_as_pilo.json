  "content": "IndiGo will have to inform the aviation regulator this week-most likely on Monday-whether it can continue operating over 2,000 flights a day once its exemption from the new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) rules for A320 pilots expires on February 10, a Times of India report said on Monday.\n\nThe revised safety norms significantly increase pilot requirements, putting pressure on flight schedules.\n\nIf the airline indicates that it cannot sustain the current number of daily flights under the new rules, authorities are expected to intervene and mandate capacity cuts to prevent a repeat of the large-scale disruptions witnessed in December, the Times of India noted. Those disruptions had led the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to impose a fine of Rs 22.2 crore onIndiGo-an amount that pilots' unions later criticised as inadequate.\n\nThe Times of India said the DGCA has been holding regular meetings with IndiGo to assess its preparedness for the post-February 10 scenario. The airline has shared details of its pilot hiring plans and has been conducting trial runs using its scheduling software to align available crew strength with the number of flights planned. Officials familiar with the discussions told the Times of India that IndiGo is expected to present a clearer picture of its readiness early next week.\n\nIt is learnt, as reported by the Times of India, that from February 1 the airline will begin planning crew rosters strictly in line with the new FDTL norms, without factoring in the temporary exemption that ends later in the month. IndiGo has already reduced flights for the remainder of the winter schedule, which runs until the last Saturday of March, and plans to operate its full network within these reduced levels under the revised rules. The airline is also unlikely to seek any further exemptions, the report added.\n\nThe aviation ministry and the DGCA are closely monitoring the situation. Sources quoted by the Times of India said regulators are determined not to allow a recurrence of last December's disruptions.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) has sharply criticised the DGCA's action against IndiGo, calling the Rs 22.2 crore fine \"peanuts,\" the Times of India reported. FIP president Captain CS Randhawa said the regulator's probe acknowledged disruptions only on December 3, 4 and 5, whereas the turmoil actually stretched until mid-December and was far more extensive.\n\nCaptain Randhawa also questioned the regulator's approach, the Times of India noted. He argued that issuing a warning letter after such widespread disruption undermined the seriousness of the violation. He further asked why the FDTL exemption had not been withdrawn despite flight cuts, pointing out that the DGCA can levy a penalty of Rs 30 lakh for each day of non-compliance with the new duty norms. \"Does this mean non-compliance with the law can simply be traded for a fine?\" he asked, as quoted by the Times of India.\n\nResponding to the developments, IndiGo said it remains committed to fully complying with regulatory directions. The airline stated that it is undertaking a detailed review of its internal processes to strengthen resilience and ensure it emerges stronger from the episode, while maintaining its operational record of over 19 years, the Times of India reported.",
