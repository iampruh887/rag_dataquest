  "content": "The Nifty 50 continued to trade in a tight range of 300 points on a closing basis for the last four sessions, with mixed-to-bearish signals from technical and momentum indicators. According to experts, the index needs to break either 25,600 (around the 100-day EMA) for a downside move toward 25,450 (immediate key support) or 25,900 (50-day EMA) for an upward journey toward 26,000, as above it the 26,200â€“26,300 zone can be a possible target. Meanwhile, as long as the Bank Nifty holds 59,500 on a closing basis, the chances of a move beyond 59,800â€“60,000 are high; however, below it, 59,300â€“59,000 are the levels to watch.\n\nOn January 14, the Nifty 50 slipped 67 points to 25,666, while the Bank Nifty rose 1.35 points to 59,580. Market breadth was marginally in favour of bears. A total of 1,498 shares declined against 1,385 advancing shares on the NSE.\n\nNifty Outlook and Strategy\n\nSudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities\n\nThe benchmark index Nifty marked a fresh all-time high of 26,373 on January 5, but since then it has entered a corrective phase. This decline found support near the 100-day EMA, a crucial technical level that has held firm over the past four sessions. Currently, the index is oscillating around this zone, reflecting a phase of consolidation. The weekly chart suggests indecision among market participants, as bulls and bears struggle for dominance.\n\nAdding to this picture of uncertainty, Wednesdayâ€™s session saw the index move within a narrow range of 188 points, the tightest range in the last four trading days. This price action resulted in the formation of an NR4 (Narrow Range 4) pattern on the daily chart, often considered a precursor to a potential breakout in either direction. Technically, the 20-day EMA continues to slope downward, while the 50-day and 100-day EMAs remain flat, indicating a lack of clear trend strength. Momentum indicators echo this indecisiveness, with the daily RSI fluctuating between 38.55 and 42.84 for four consecutive sessions, suggesting muted momentum and a wait-and-watch approach by traders.\n\nGoing forward, the Nifty is approaching a critical juncture where price action could dictate the next directional move. On the downside, the 25,500â€“25,450 zone will act as a key support area, and any breach below this level could accelerate selling pressure. Conversely, on the upside, the 50-day EMA zone of 25,880â€“25,900 will serve as an immediate hurdle for the index. A decisive breakout on either side of this range is likely to pave the way for a trending move, setting the tone for the short-term market trajectory. Traders should closely monitor these levels, as they hold the potential to trigger significant volatility.\n\nKey Resistance: 25,880, 25,900\n\nKey Support: 25,500, 25,450\n\nStrategy: Buy Nifty Futures around 25,670â€“25,750, with a stop-loss of 25,600, targeting 25,960.\n\nNilesh Jain, Head â€“ Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst (Equity Research) at Centrum Broking\n\nThe Nifty index remained under selling pressure for the second straight session and formed a doji-like candle on the daily chart, signalling indecision among market participants. This price action suggests that the index may continue to trade in a range and extend the consolidation in the short term.\n\nOn the downside, immediate support is placed near the 100-DMA at 25,560, followed by the 25,470 level. On the upside, the 21-DMA around 25,990 continues to act as a strong resistance, and a decisive breakout above this zone is essential for any sustained short-term upside momentum.\n\nFrom an indicator perspective, the MACD has registered a bearish crossover on both daily and weekly charts, pointing to underlying weakness despite the possibility of a brief pullback. The broader trend remains fragile as long as the index stays below the 26,000 mark. Additionally, India VIX has been trending higher, hinting at a potential rise in near-term volatility, which could pose a mild headwind for the market.\n\nGiven the overall technical structure, a decisive breakdown below 25,650 in Nifty Futures could accelerate selling pressure and lead to a corrective decline toward the 25,400 level. Therefore, a sell-on-breakdown strategy is recommended below 25,650 in Nifty Futures.\n\nKey Resistance: 25,790, 25,990\n\nKey Support: 25,560, 25,470\n\nStrategy: Sell Nifty Futures below 25,650, with a stop-loss of 25,780, targeting 25,400.\n\nRupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities\n\nThe Nifty remained volatile during the day and traded with a bearish bias for most of the session on Wednesday. On the hourly chart, the index failed to move above the 20 EMA, indicating a prevailing weak trend. Additionally, the bearish crossover between the 21 EMA and the 50 EMA on the hourly chart remains intact, reinforcing negative sentiment.\n\nThe daily RSI has witnessed a breakdown from an upward consolidation, confirming a meaningful shift in momentum. In the short term, sentiment is likely to remain weak, with the potential for further downside. Support is placed at 25,600, below which a deeper correction may unfold. On the higher end, resistance is placed at 25,835.\n\nKey Resistance: 25,835, 26,000\n\nKey Support: 25,600, 25,500\n\nStrategy: Buy Nifty 25,600 PE of January 20 expiry around Rs 75, with a stop-loss of Rs 48, targeting Rs 120.\n\nBank Nifty - Outlook and Positioning\n\nSudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities\n\nThe banking benchmark index, Bank Nifty, has been consistently outperforming the frontline indices over the past few sessions, reflecting strong sectoral momentum. Currently, the index is trading above all its crucial moving averages, signalling a well-established uptrend. In contrast, the Nifty is still positioned below its 20-day and 50-day EMA levels, highlighting relative weakness in the broader market. A key technical observation is that the Bank Nifty-to-Nifty ratio chart has surged to a 609-day high and continues to rise, underscoring the strong outperformance of banking stocks compared to the benchmark index.\n\nLooking ahead, the zone of 60,000â€“60,100 will act as a critical resistance for Bank Nifty. A decisive and sustained breakout above 60,100 could trigger a sharp upside move, potentially driving the index towards 60,600, followed by 61,000 in the short term. On the downside, immediate support is placed in the 59,300â€“59,200 zone, which will be closely monitored by traders for any signs of weakness.\n\nKey Resistance: 60,000, 60,100\n\nKey Support: 59,300, 59,200\n\nStrategy: Buy Bank Nifty Futures around 59,700â€“59,800, with a stop-loss of 59,400, targeting 60,500.\n\nNilesh Jain, Head â€“ Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst (Equity Research) at Centrum Broking\n\nBank Nifty is showing resilience and witnessing outperformance over the Nifty index. It is also sustaining above the 50-DMA and 21-DMA placed at 59,150 and 59,420 levels, respectively, which are acting as strong support.\n\nA sustained move above 60,000 could trigger short covering and pave the way for further upside toward the 60,500 zone.\n\nHence, based on this rationale, if Bank Nifty breaks the resistance of 60,010 in the futures, it can be bought with a stop-loss at 59,710, with the potential to move toward 60,450.\n\nKey Resistance: 59,800, 60,100\n\nKey Support: 59,400, 59,150\n\nStrategy: Buy Bank Nifty Futures above 60,010, with a stop-loss of 59,710, targeting 60,450.\n\nRupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities\n\nThe Bank Nifty managed to stay afloat above the support at 59,500. On the daily chart, the index found support above the falling channel, leading to a recovery over the past few days. At the moment, the near-term trend is not clear.\n\nOn the higher end, 59,800 may act as an immediate resistance; a decisive breakout above this level could trigger a smart rally in the index. Subsequently, it may move towards 60,500 over the near to short term. On the lower end, support is placed at 59,500, below which the index may slip back into a consolidation phase.\n\nKey Resistance: 59,800, 60,500\n\nKey Support: 59,500, 59,000\n\nStrategy: Buy Bank Nifty 59,500 PE of January expiry above Rs 370, with a stop-loss of Rs 300, targeting Rs 550.",
