It is the rupee.\n\nOver the past year, the Indian currency’s steady slide against the US dollar, pound and euro has quietly added lakhs of rupees to the cost of overseas education. The change has been gradual enough to escape daily headlines, but for parents wiring fees and students paying rent abroad, the impact is immediate and painful.\n\nA master’s degree in the US that cost Rs 40 lakh two years ago can now easily cost Rs 45-48 lakh, even if the university has not increased its fees much. The difference is not ambition or lifestyle creep. It is currency math. And that math compounds over time.\n\nThe hidden multiplier effect\n\nMost families plan for foreign education in rupees. They calculate a total budget, look at savings,loansand maybe some help from relatives. What often gets underestimated is that almost every major expense—tuition, accommodation, health insurance, even groceries—moves in line with the foreign currency.\n\nWhen the rupee weakens, the cost does not rise once. It rises every semester.\n\nConsider a student in the US paying $40,000 a year in total expenses. At Rs 75 to a dollar, that is Rs 30 lakh. At Rs 83-85, it becomes Rs 33-34 lakh. Over a two-year course, that is an extra Rs 6-8 lakh, without any change in lifestyle or university.\n\nIn the UK and Europe, where fees are often paid in pounds or euros, the impact can be even sharper.\n\nEducation consultants say many families only realise this after the first or second remittance.\n\nLoans don’t insulate you from currency risk\n\nEducation loans soften the immediate burden, but they do not eliminate the problem. The loan is disbursed in tranches, and each tranche is converted at the prevailing exchange rate.\n\nIf the rupee keeps weakening, later disbursements effectively become more expensive than earlier ones. The student ends up borrowing more rupees for the same dollar or pound amount.\n\nThere is a second-order effect too. A larger rupee loan means higher EMIs after graduation, at a time when many students are still settling into their first jobs abroad or back home.\n\nIn other words, currency risk does not stop at admission. It follows you into your working life.\n\nLiving costs are where the pain shows first\n\nTuition fees are fixed and predictable. It is daily life where the currency shock becomes visible. Rent, transport, food, phone bills—everything is paid in foreign currency. When parents send a monthly allowance, the amount in rupees keeps creeping up even if the student is spending exactly the same abroad.\n\nStudents in cities like London, New York, Toronto and Sydney are feeling this the most. Many have already started cutting discretionary spending, sharing rooms, or picking up part-time work just to stay within family budgets.\n\nFor families back home, this often shows up as “temporary top-ups” that slowly become permanent.\n\nThe planning mistake most people make\n\nThe most common mistake is treating foreign education as a one-time cost decision. In reality, it is a multi-year financial commitment exposed to currency, inflation and interest rate risks. Families often plan for the base cost, add a small buffer, and assume things will broadly work out.\n\nBut even a 3-4 percent annual depreciation in the rupee, compounded over two or three years, can blow through that buffer.\n\nWhat makes it harder is that this risk is invisible when you are filling out application forms or paying the first deposit.\n\nCan this be managed at all?\n\nSome families try to pre-fund part of the cost by converting and parking foreign currency early. Others look at education-focused forex cards or overseas accounts to smooth timing risk.\n\nBut for most middle-class households, the real solution is more conservative budgeting: assuming a weaker rupee than today’s rate, not today’s rate itself.\n\nFinancial planners say that when calculating affordability, families should stress-test their numbers at a meaningfully worse exchange rate and see if the plan still holds.\n\nIf it does not, the course was never really affordable—it just looked affordable at one lucky moment in the currency cycle.\n\nThe emotional side of the equation\n\nThere is also a quieter pressure at work. Once a student is already abroad, very few families will say, “We cannot afford this anymore, come back.” So they stretch. They dip into retirement savings. They take top-up loans. They postpone other goals.\n\nThe falling rupee turns what was meant to be an investment in a child’s future into a slow, persistent financial squeeze.\n\nNone of this means studying abroad is a bad idea. But it does mean that in 2026, the real cost of foreign education is no longer just about which university you get into.\n\nIt is also about whether your family balance sheet can survive two or three years of an unfriendly currency.\n\nThe rupee does not announce its impact with a crisis headline. It shows up quietly—in higher remittances, bigger loans, and plans that need constant revision.\n\nAnd for families paying in instalments, it is rewriting the bill in real time.\n\n1. Should I wait for the rupee to strengthen before sending my child abroad?\n\nTrying to time currencies is extremely difficult. If the academic decision makes sense, it is better to plan with a conservative exchange rate assumption rather than wait indefinitely for a better rate that may never come.\n\n2. Does paying fees in one shot protect against currency risk?\n\nIt can reduce risk for that portion of the cost, but living expenses and later payments will still be exposed. Most families cannot pre-fund the entire course anyway.\n\n3. Is studying abroad still worth it despite the rising cost?\n\nIt can be, depending on the course, country and career outcomes. But the decision now needs to be made with much more realistic currency and cost assumptions than in the past.",
