  "content": "Indian benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty, are likely to see a muted opening on January 16,¬†with cues coming from GIFT Nifty, which was trading marginally lower at around 25,779.50.\n\nTrack the latest updates on¬†GIFT Nifty right here on Moneycontrol.\n\nIndian markets ended lower in a volatile, rangebound session on January 14 as weakness in auto, IT and realty stocks offset strength in metal, PSU banking and oil & gas counters. Investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of the US Supreme Court's decision on the legality of President Donald Trump's tariff measures.\n\nAt close, the Sensex was down 244.98 points or 0.29 percent at 83,382.71, and the Nifty was down 66.70 points or 0.26 percent at 25,665.60.\n\nThe GIFT Nifty is trading flat at around 25,779.50, indicating a muted start for the day.\n\nAsian Equities (Mixed)\n\nAsian stocks are set for their longest¬†weekly winning streak since May, with a regional gauge of technology shares climbing to a record as investors step up bets¬†on artificial intelligence.\n\nUS stocks rose on Thursday after two days ‚Äãof declines as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs shares shot up following upbeat quarterly results, while Taiwan-based chipmaker ‚ÄåTSMC's blockbuster results boosted shares of US chipmakers.\n\nThe Dow ‚Å†Jones Industrial Average rose 292.81 points, or 0.60%, to 49,442.44, the S&P 500 gained 17.87 points, or 0.26%, to 6,944.47 and ‚Äçthe Nasdaq Composite gained 58.27 points, or 0.25%, to 23,530.02.\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries and 2-year Treasuries was trading with little changed at 4.18% and 3.53%, respectively.\n\nThe dollar was poised for a third weekly gain on Friday after positive U.S. economic data lowered expectations for rate cuts by the Federal Reserve anytime soon.\n\nAsian Currencies (Mixed)\n\nAsian currencies were trading mixed in the red in the early trade on Friday, with Indonesian Rupiah, South Korean Won, Thai Baht, Malaysian Ringgit, Taiwan Dollar were trading lower, while Japanese Yen, Philippines Peso, Singapore Dollar, China Renminbi were trading higher.\n\nOil prices were flat on Friday with both Brent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate moving only a few cents from their closing prices after the likelihood of a U.S. strike on Iran receded.\n\nSilver dropped on Friday after the US¬†refrained from putting import tariffs on critical minerals, but was still up 15% for the week on surging demand for precious¬†metals.\n\nOn January 14, the Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) offloaded equities worth around Rs¬†4781 crore, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) continued their buying as they bought equities worth Rs¬†5217 crore.\n\nHope you're all set for today's trade. We wish you a profitable day ahead.\n\nDisclaimer:¬†The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
