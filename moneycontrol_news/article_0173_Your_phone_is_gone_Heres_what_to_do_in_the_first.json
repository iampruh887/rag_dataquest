  "content": "When a phone is stolen, the first reaction is rarely calm. There is shock, anger, and the instinct to chase what is already gone. Somewhere in that chaos, an uncomfortable realisation follows: your phone is not just a device. It is your wallet, your identity, and the key to your bank accounts.\n\nWhat you do in the first 30 minutes matters far more than what phone you buy next. The priority is not tracking the handset. It is protecting your money.\n\nHere is how to think about those first critical minutes.\n\nFirst, stop the financial bleeding\n\nThe most immediate risk after a phone theft is unauthorised access to banking and payment apps. Even if your phone was locked, you should assume compromise.\n\nCall your bank immediately and block mobile banking access. Do not wait to “check if anything has happened”. Ask them to disable UPI, mobile app logins, and card tokenisation linked to the device.\n\nNext, block your SIM card through your telecom provider. This step is crucial because many banking and payment systems still rely on SMS-based OTPs. As long as the SIM is active, your accounts remain vulnerable.\n\nIf you use credit or debit cards saved on your phone, call the card issuer and request a temporary block. This is faster than disputing fraudulent transactions later.\n\nThese calls are uncomfortable, but they are the fastest way to put a wall around your money.\n\nLock down digital access, not just the device\n\nOnce the immediate banking risk is contained, move to your email account. This is the control centre for password resets across services.\n\nChange your email password from another device and enable two-factor authentication if it is not already active. If someone has access to your email, they effectively have access to everything else.\n\nThen change passwords for key apps, especially banking, investment platforms, payment wallets, and cloud storage. Do not try to do this for every app. Focus on the ones connected to money and identity.\n\nIf you use Google or Apple services, mark the phone as lost and sign out of it remotely. This helps limit access even if the phone remains powered on.\n\nFile the complaint, even if recovery feels unlikely\n\nFiling a police complaint is not just a formality. It is required for SIM replacement, insurance claims, and in some cases, banking disputes.\n\nProvide the IMEI number if you have it. Many people do not know where to find it until it is too late. If you have ever emailed yourself the phone bill or saved it digitally, check there.\n\nIn India, registering the IMEI on the government’s lost phone portal can help block the device across networks. Recovery is rare, but disabling misuse is still valuable.\n\nDo not forget the quieter risks\n\nPhones today hold far more than payment apps. Photos of documents, saved IDs, notes with passwords, workplace emails, and cloud access all matter.\n\nIf you had scans of Aadhaar, PAN, passports, or medical records on your phone, assume they may be exposed. Monitor accounts closely over the next few weeks.\n\nInform your workplace IT team if your office email or work apps were on the device. This is not about blame. It is about containment.\n\nWhat not to do in those first 30 minutes\n\nDo not log into random tracking links sent by strangers claiming they found your phone. Do not delay blocking access because you hope to recover it. Do not assume that a locked screen is enough protection.\n\nTime lost here is expensive.\n\nAfter the panic settles\n\nOnce accounts are secured, SIMs replaced, and passwords reset, take time to review your digital hygiene. Phones get stolen. What should not be stolen is your financial control.\n\nReduce the number of apps linked to payments. Use app-level locks. Keep emergency contact numbers written down somewhere offline. And know, in advance, which helpline you will call first.\n\nBecause when your phone disappears, clarity is more valuable than speed. And protecting your money is always more urgent than replacing a device.",
