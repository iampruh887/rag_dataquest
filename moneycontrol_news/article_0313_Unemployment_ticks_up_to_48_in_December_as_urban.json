  "content": "India’s unemployment rate edged up marginally to 4.8 percent in December, from 4.7 percent in November, even as more people entered the workforce and overall employment indicators continued to improve, official data released on January 15 showed.\n\nThe slight increase in joblessness came alongside a steady rise in labour force participation, suggesting that the labour market is absorbing new entrants, but not fast enough to prevent a modest uptick in the headline unemployment rate.\n\nThe labour force participation rate (LFPR) for those aged 15 years and above rose to 56.1 percent in December, the highest level recorded this year, up from 55.8 percent in November. At the same time, the worker population ratio (WPR) inched up to 53.4 percent from 53.2 percent, indicating that employment also expanded during the month.\n\nThe underlying trends, however, diverged sharply between rural and urban areas. Rural unemployment remained unchanged at 3.9 percent, pointing to relatively stable labour market conditions in the countryside. Urban areas, by contrast, saw a rise in joblessness, with the unemployment rate climbing to 6.7 percent in December from 6.5 percent a month earlier. This increase in cities was the primary driver of the overall rise in unemployment.\n\nFemale participation continued to be a bright spot. The female LFPR rose to 35.3 percent in December, the highest level seen this year, supported mainly by stronger participation in rural areas. Encouragingly, urban female unemployment eased slightly to 9.1 percent from 9.3 percent in November, suggesting some improvement in job prospects for women in cities even as overall urban unemployment edged higher.\n\nThe rise in unemployment appears to reflect more people entering the job market rather than a contraction in employment, highlighting the ongoing challenge of generating sufficient urban jobs to keep pace with a growing and increasingly participative workforce.",
