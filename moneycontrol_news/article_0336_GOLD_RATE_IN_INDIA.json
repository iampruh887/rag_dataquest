Not just in the form of jewellery. but gold is also valued in forms of art and coins. Despite a continuous hike in gold prices, people in India continue to invest in gold on a regular basis. Gold prices in India keep changing due to multiple factors including global market condition and the strength of the US dollar, thus leaving varying impact from city to city depending on demand and supply in local markets. If you are also planning to invest in gold, consider taking a look at the following details.\n\nBefore knowing gold rates in India, it is important to know the difference between 24-carat and 22-carat gold. While 24-carat gold is a 100 percent pure form of gold with no trace of any other metal, 22-carat gold has traces of alloyed metals like silver or copper and has 91.67 percent pure gold.\n\nThere are several factors that affect gold rates in India including fluctuations in the global market to the strength of the USD, import costs, interest rates on banks' fixed deposits, economic stability, seasonal prices, inflation and demand-supply, among others. While high inflation rates increase the demand for gold and vice versa, its price also shoots up as with an increase in demand. Apart from a few global conditions, the international spot price of gold also affects the metal value of gold in India. Just like any other product, demand and supply also affect gold prices. With a rise in demand and supply for gold, its prices have also increased.\n\nOn the domestic front, gold futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) rose Rs 3,698, or 2.7 per cent, over the past week, touching a record high of Rs 1,43,590 per 10 grams on Wednesday\n\nEven as buying gold has turned out to be a secure form of investment in India, more and more people are engaging themselves in buying gold. With gold rates skyrocketing in recent times, it is important to take note of a few things before investing in precious metals.\n\nYESTERDAY Silver Rate Per Gram/Kg\n\nDetermined by a combination of factors including international market behaviour, demand, supply and inflation, among others, gold prices in India are indicated by the Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd. and the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX).\n\nFactors that potentially affect gold rates in India are fluctuations in the global market, strength of the USD, import costs, interest rates on banks' fixed deposits, economic stability, seasonal prices, inflation and demand-supply.\n\n24-carat gold is considered to be the purest form with 100 percent gold and no traces of any other metal.\n\nAuspicious festivals like Dhanteras, Makar Sankranti, Akshaya Tritiya, Dussehra, and Diwali are considered the best time to buy gold in India. It is primarily because jewellers offer a range of discounts on making charges.\n\nThe purity of gold can be determined by checking the 'Hallmark' sign on the jewellery. Hallmarked jewellery certifies the claimed purity of gold and further engraves the purity level along with the name of the retailer to ensure that customers are not duped.\n\nIn a bid to bring transparency into jewellery shopping, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has been designated to implement hallmarking of gold jewellery to ensure that customers buy the purest form of gold. Through this process, the proportionate content of precious metals is determined and recorded through specific marks such as the BIS logo, the purity of the metal and a unique HUID number.\n\nTo ensure that customers are not duped and sold off with an impure form of gold that has a mix of other alloyed metals, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has been designated to implement hallmarking of gold jewellery.\n\nBeginning with the custom tax that the government imposes for importing gold into the country, it is followed by other taxes levied by sellers including the GST, making charges, and TDS.\n\nThe fluctuation in the international markets largely impacts the price of gold in India. For example, any rise in the US Fed interest rate will result in money flowing into government securities and the banking system from gold reserves. India is one of the largest gold importers and sees a major impact with fluctuations in gold prices on global markets.\n\nBeing the safest and profitable form of investment in India, investing in gold will not only come as an asset but is also considered superior to currency. It is one of the few assets that is tangible and creates a perception of safety among investors. Both purchasing and selling gold are very easy in India.\n\nGold investment in India is popular and can be done through various avenues. These include purchasing gold jewelry, coins, bars, or investing in gold ETFs. Gold jewelry serves a dual purpose of adornment and investment, although factors like making charges should be considered. Gold coins and bars can be obtained from authorized dealers or banks in different weights. Alternatively, investors can opt for gold ETFs, which offer liquidity and convenience. The government also issues Sovereign Gold Bonds periodically, providing an alternative investment option. It's important to track gold prices as they are subject to fluctuations influenced by various factors. Proper storage, such as bank lockers or secure vaults, is essential for physical gold investments. Consulting with a financial advisor is recommended to make informed investment decisions based on individual financial goals and risk tolerance.\n\nFurthermore, the Gold Monetization Scheme introduced by the government allows individuals to deposit their idle gold with banks and earn interest on it. This scheme aims to put the idle gold held by households to productive use. However, it's important to note that gold investments come with risks. While gold has historically been considered a safe haven asset, its value can also fluctuate based on international market trends, currency exchange rates, and economic factors. Therefore, it's prudent to carefully monitor gold prices and assess the market conditions before making any investment decisions. Seeking guidance from a financial advisor or investment professional can provide valuable insights and help align your gold investment strategy with your overall financial goals.\n\nMoneycontrol makes no guarantee or warranty on the accuracy of the data provided on this site, the prevailing rates are susceptible to change with Market value and provided on an as-is basis.
