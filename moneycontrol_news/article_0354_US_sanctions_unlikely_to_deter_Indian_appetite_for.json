This could even potentially push up India’s import bill and inflation pressures.\n\nThe country has ample physical supply options including Middle Eastern grades that would replace the bulk quickly, supplemented by US and West African barrels. However, analysts note that the real cost would be losing discounted crude resulting in higher average prices and a stronger focus on term contracts, diversification, and refinery optimization.\n\nAs per Kpler, India’s annual crude import bill could rise by $3–4 billion, assuming a conservative $5/bbl differential on 1.8 mbd of displaced volumes if Russian crude becomes inaccessible due to escalating sanctions or penalties.\n\nLosing this pricing cushion would not only inflate input costs but also strain fiscal balances if the government intervenes to prevent retail fuel inflation.\n\nThe country’s crude oil import bill stood at $80.9 billion during April-November of FY26, as per data from the government’s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell.\n\nIndia’s Russian crude imports fell sharply in December 2025, dropping to an estimated 1.2 mbd from 1.84 mbd in November, following new US sanctions on Russia’s major oil companies Rosneft and Lukoil.\n\nWhile this marks the lowest intake since late 2022, the decline reflects a short-term procurement adjustment rather than a structural shift, as per Kpler.\n\n“Russian barrels remain economically competitive and well-suited to India’s refining system, with volumes expected to recover from January as trade shifts to non-designated intermediaries. Absent broader secondary sanctions, Russian crude is likely to remain structurally embedded in India’s slate,” Ritolia said.\n\nRussian crude continues to find its way into India through an expanding network of intermediaries, traders, and logistical workarounds.\n\nWhile direct purchases from Rosneft and Lukoil have softened owing to US sanctions, alternative sellers including Tatneft, Redwood Global Supply, Rusexport, Morexport, and Alghaf Marine are increasingly stepping in to fill the commercial gap, Kpler said.\n\nFor Indian refiners, Russian barrels continue to remain competitive and marketable.  “Russian barrel imports are therefore expected to gradually re-normalise from January, albeit through more intermediated and less transparent structures, with the barrels themselves remaining competitive and marketable,” Ritolia said.\n\nAs per data from Kpler, Russian Urals differentials against Oman/Dubai on a Delivered ex-ship (DES) West Coast India basis have stabilised at a discount of around $7 per barrel since early December, down roughly $5/bbl from pre-sanctions levels.\n\nRitolia noted that this adjustment also reflects a broader softening in the Asian medium sour market, with competing Middle Eastern grades such as Arab Light and Basrah Medium weakening by $1.50-2.00/bbl over the same period.\n\nAs such, Russian barrels continue to remain very attractive for Indian buyers as the spread with competing Middle Eastern grades now reaches $8-10/bbl.\n\n“The financial gain is substantial for refiners willing to take the risk. India’s high-complexity refineries can replace Russian barrels by sourcing additional barrels from the Middle East, West Africa, the Americas, and North America, but often at the cost of margin compression, leaving Russian crude competitive on both price and refinery fit,” Ritolia said.\n\nLooking into 2026, India’s crude import strategy is expected to remain pragmatic and highly diversified, balancing affordability, security of supply, and geopolitical risk, analysts note.\n\nMiddle Eastern suppliers including Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE, and Kuwait will continue to anchor India’s crude slate, Kpler notes, while incremental volumes from the US and select Atlantic Basin producers will provide India flexibility.\n\n“On the demand side, new capacity additions—including the Rajasthan refinery start-up in H1 2026 and expansions at Panipat, NRL, and other complexes are set to structurally increase India’s crude import requirements,” Kpler noted.\n\nWhile Russia remains central to India’s crude slate, Middle Eastern, Latin American, and US barrels will continue to act as diversification buffers rather than full replacements, with Russian crude likely to persist through increasingly indirect channels as long as broader secondary sanctions are avoided, Ritolia said.",
