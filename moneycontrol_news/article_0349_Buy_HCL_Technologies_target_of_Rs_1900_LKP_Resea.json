  "content": "LKP Research's research report onHCL Technologies\n\nHCL Technologies Ltd (HCL) sustained its strong growth momentum into Q3FY26, as reflected in robust revenue performance and healthy deal wins. HCL reported revenue growth of 4.2%/4.8% QoQ/YoY in CC (Constant Currency) terms to Rs.338bn, driven by a revival in the software segment which posted 28%/3.1%, QoQ/YoY CC growth. The services segment, meanwhile, maintained steady performance with growth of 1.8%/5%, QoQ/YoY CC, despite seasonal softness arising from furloughs and lower utilization levels. Growth in services segment was supported by the Advanced AI portfolio, which generated revenues of USD 146mn, up 19.9% QoQ in CC terms, reflecting benefits from sustained capex in AI-led initiatives. New deal TCV stood at a strong USD 3bn (+43.5%/17% YoY/QoQ), including a USD 473mn, five-year strategic engagement with a global apparel retailer. Booking momentum was primarily driven by Applications and ER&D services, which together contributed 62% of total bookings.\n\nWe assign a BUY rating on HCL, supported by its superior performance versus Tier-1 peers despite the absence of a broad-based recovery in discretionary client spending, with a TP of Rs.1,900, valuing the stock at 22x FY28E EPS.\n\nFor all recommendations report,click here\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
