  "content": "Investors holding Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) 2019–20 Series II can opt for premature redemption today, i.e. January 16, 2026, as Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced its early exit. The tranche completes five years from its date of issue which makes it eligible for premature redemption.\n\nAccording to Government of India notification dated May 30, 2019, premature redemption of SGBs is allowed after the fifth year from the date of issue, provided it falls on an interest payment date. The SGB 2019–20 Series II was issued on January 16, 2019, making January 16, 2026, the next eligible date for early exit.\n\nWhat is the redemption price for SGB 2019–20 Series II\n\nThe central bank has fixed the premature redemption price at Rs 14,092 per unit. The SGB 2020–21 Series IV was issued at a price of Rs 3,393 per unit.\n\nHow is the redemption price calculated\n\nThe price has been calculated based on the simple average of the closing price of gold of 999 purity for the previous three business days, as published by the India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA).\n\nAccordingly, gold prices for January 12, January 13, and January 14, 2026 were considered to arrive at the redemption value.\n\nThe redemption amount will be credited directly to the investor’s registered bank account.\n\nHow much did investors gain?\n\nThe premature redemption price of Rs 14,092 per unit reflects strong gains for investors who bought the SGB 2019–20 Series II at the time of issuance in July 2019. The bond was issued at an issue price of around Rs 3,393 per unit, meaning investors have seen a capital appreciation of nearly Rs 10,700 per unit, or over 315 percent, from gold price movement alone. In addition to this sharp rise in gold prices, investors also earned 2.5 percent annual interest, paid semi-annually, which further boosted overall returns during the holding period.\n\nFor example, an investor who invested Rs 1 lakh in this SGB tranche at the time of issue would receive over Rs 4.1 lakh on premature redemption, excluding the interest income earned over the years.\n\nHow premature redemption works\n\nSGBs have an 8-year tenure, but investors are allowed to exit early starting the 5th year—only on the dates when semi-annual interest is paid. Premature redemption must be initiated through the investor’s bank, post office, or agent from whom the bond was purchased, typically with a request submitted several days in advance.\n\nWhat is the Sovereign Gold Bonds scheme?\n\nSGB Scheme was introduced by the Indian government in November, 2025 as an alternative to attract gold ownership. The bonds were issued by the RBI for and on behalf of the Centre. The bonds denominated in grams of gold offered investors dual benefit-- earning a fixed annual interest of 2.5% on the issue price and earning capital appreciation linked to gold prices. The scheme majorly aimed to reduce India’s reliability on imported physical gold, curb hoarding, and channel household savings into financial assets.\n\nHow Do Sovereign Gold Bonds Work?\n\nIf you want to invest in Sovereign Gold Bonds, all you need is to purchase Sovereign Gold Bond from either a bank, SHCIL or designated post offices. For offline purchases, an SGB certificate from the holding of the issuing bank or designated post offices is issued. You can collect it. In case you have purchased an SGB online, your demat account portfolio will reflect. The SGBs offer an interest of 2.5% per annum.\n\nWhat is the tax treatment of Sovereign Gold Bonds\n\nAs per the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (Section 43 of 1961) the interest on the SGBs is taxable. When an individual redeems these bonds, they are free from paying capital gains tax. Any capital gains that result from the transfer of the bonds on the exchange will be eligible for the indexation benefits.",
