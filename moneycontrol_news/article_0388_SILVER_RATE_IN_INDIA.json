Silver is purchased in different forms including silver coins, bars, jewellery, idols, and utensils, among other items. Before investing in silver, it is important to know the current silver rate and further keep track of the market conditions. Apart from the market condition, one must also know about the factors concerning the purity of the silver, the authenticity of the seller, and the standards for determining weight. If you’re planning to invest in silver, here's what you need to know.\n\nAs per the latest numbers, the silver rate in India stands at Rs 70.9 per gram and Rs 70,900 per kg. The prices are updated every day, at par with industry standards.\n\nLike gold prices, silver prices in India are also affected by a number of factors like demand, global market movement, political factors, and government policies.\n\nDemand:During festive and wedding seasons, the demand for purchasing precious metals like gold and silver rises significantly, thus leaving a major impact on their prices.\n\nGlobal market:While silver is considered to be a safer option for investors due to its less volatility, the global market movement also affects the price of silver in India. A drop in oil prices and the dollar usually causes a rise in silver prices. For example, if Rupee falls against the Dollar and the international prices are stable, silver is expected to become costlier inIndia.\n\nPolitical factors and government policies:Global political factors and a number of government policies also affect silver prices in India as any kind of change leads to a global impact, thus playing a role in silver prices.\n\nThe surge in silver imports comes at time when gold has slipped and petroleum growth slowed, likely driven by global price spikes and China export curbs\n\nSilver rates:On the basis of international market prices, silver rates also change on a regular basis. This is why it is important to keep track of silver prices to buy them at the best rates.\n\nMaking charges:Just like gold, jewellers may levy making charges on silver jewellery or cutlery. Therefore, it is important to ask directly about the applied making charges to the jewellers.\n\nSellers:People need to research the sellers before purchasing silver to ensure that they buy genuine products with verified purity. This will not only provide them with good quality silver but will also help them to get the best resale value of silver.\n\nCertification:While buying silver, it is important to check the certification of the jewellery or the other items.\n\nIs investing in silver a bad or good idea?While the cost of silver is far lesser than gold in India, it is still a safe option for investment. Reselling silver jewellery, cutlery, coins, or bars will help get better returns, based on the current market prices.\n\nHow to Differentiate Between Pure Silver and Sterling Silver?Fine silver is 99.9% pure silver and is soft in comparison to sterling silver. Sterling on the other hand is an alloy that is made mostly of silver and includes a small percentage of copper and zinc to strengthen it. While both of these look almost the same, silver is not very durable due to softness and sterling silver can last a lifetime if properly cared for. On the other hand, sterling silver is more easily tarnished than pure silver, because of the other metals in it.\n\nGlobal market fluctuations and inappropriate or unstable demand and supply ratios can lead to an increase in silver rates, thus impacting silver prices in India.\n\nIn comparison to silver jewellery, silver coins or bars are significantly heavier and more durable. Thus, buying silver coins or bars can assure a better return and resale value.\n\nOne can purchase silver bars from banks, certified jewellers, and online agents in India. Customers need to note that banks usually charge higher rates, in comparison to jewellery shops because of the purity checks and assurance that they provide.\n\nHallmarking is essential for ensuring the purity of the silver that you are purchasing. It is used as a seal of purity.\n\nConsidered a purity indicator, while hallmarking is not yet mandatory for silver, getting it done will help ensure that your purchase meets certain quality standards.\n\nThe best time to buy silver is during festive or wedding seasons, as jewellers often provide exciting offers and discounts on purchases.\n\nVAT and GST are usually charged on both the purchase and sale of silver in India.\n\nWhile there are no such regulations over the limit of owning silver in India, the government does charge certain taxes after a certain purchase limit is crossed.\n\nIndia is among the world’s biggest silver importers. According to a government statement, India imported nearly 245 billion Indian rupees worth of silver in FY 2022.\n\nPeople can opt for a number of ways to invest in silver in India. From purchasing silver jewellery to buying silver coins, and bars, and investing in the Commodity Futures Exchange, there are a lot of options. While silver jewellery is usually purchased for personal use, investments in coins and bars are often by banks and institutions for official purposes. Similarly, professional investors opt for investment in the Commodity Futures Exchange, while keeping an eye on the market.\n\nMoneycontrol makes no guarantee or warranty on the accuracy of the data provided on this site, the prevailing rates are susceptible to change with Market value and provided on an as-is basis.
