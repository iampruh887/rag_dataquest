  "content": "A proposed move by the US to impose a 25 percent tariff on countries trading with Iran is unlikely to dent India’s trade. Iran today accounts for barely 0.3 percent of India’s total trade, making it a marginal partner in aggregate. But the small headline number masks a sharper risk in some products where Iran remains an important supplier, leaving India exposed if curbs on Iran-linked trade increases.\n\nThe exposure is most visible on the import side, where India’s dependence on Iran is narrow but concentrated. In 2024, Iran supplied nearly 60 percent of India’s pistachio imports, about 39 percent of almonds and close to 23 percent of apples, according to trade data. These are not fringe commodities. Nuts and fruits are staples of India’s urban consumption basket, and their prices are susceptible to supply shocks. Any disruption in sourcing, whether due to higher compliance costs, shipping frictions or indirect sanctions risk, could quickly translate into price pressures for consumers.\n\nIndia’s export exposure to Iran is smaller in value terms, but in some lines it is even more concentrated. Iran absorbs nearly all of India’s exports of rosin and certain resin products and remains an important destination for bananas, oil-cake, and select machinery and chemical items. For exporters, especially in agriculture, redirecting shipments is rarely frictionless. Perishable goods like bananas have limited shelf life, and alternative markets often come with different standards, pricing dynamics or logistics costs.\n\nThese vulnerabilities are the residue of a trade relationship that has already shrunk dramatically. Since the reimposition of US sanctions in 2019, India–Iran trade has collapsed by nearly 87 percent, falling to $2.3 billion in 2024 from $17.6 billion in 2019. The most dramatic shift has been in energy. Mineral fuels once accounted for over 90 percent of India’s imports from Iran; that trade has all but vanished, plunging by 99 percent since 2019.\n\nWhat remains is a very different trade mix. India still imports roughly $1 billion worth of goods from Iran, but more than 80 percent of this now consists of organic chemicals, edible fruits and nuts. Energy has been replaced by food and intermediate inputs as the backbone of the relationship—categories where substitution is often harder and price volatility more visible.\n\nExports tell a similar story of contraction. India’s shipments to Iran have fallen 68 percent from their pre-sanctions peak. In 2024, exports stood at $1.3 billion, down sharply from $3.9 billion in 2019 and $5.4 billion in 2013. While the absolute numbers are smaller, the remaining trade is tightly concentrated in a few product lines, magnifying the impact of any further disruption.",
