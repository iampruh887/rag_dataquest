  "content": "The IPO ofAmagi Media Labsopened for public bidding today, January 13. The maiden public issue of the company has been subscribed 6 percent on Day 1.\n\nThe IPO received bids for nearly 17.47 lakh shares, as against the offer size of 2.73 crore shares, according to data on NSE. Retail Individual Investors (RII) have shown the most interest in the IPO so far, booking 28 percent of their reserved portion.\n\nNon Institutional Investors (NII) have subscribed 4 percent of the portion kept for them. Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) are yet to put any substantial bid for the IPO.\n\nAmagi Media Labs IPO GMP:\n\nAhead of listing, the unlisted shares of Amagi Media Labs were trading with a grey market premium (GMP) of 4.71 percent over the IPO price, according to data on Investorgain. The GMP has fallen from the 10.25 percent quoted by the site day before yesterday.\n\nAccording to IPO Watch, the unlisted shares of the company were trading with 5.54 percent GMP over the IPO price.\n\nAbout Amagi Media Labs IPO:\n\nAmagi Media Labs launched its initial public offering (IPO) to raise Rs 1,789 crore through a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 816 crore and an offer for sale worth Rs 973 crore by the existing investors. The price band for the IPO has been set at Rs 343-361 per share.\n\nInvestors can bid for a minimum of 41 shares, requiring an investment of Rs 14,801 at the upper price band, and in multiples thereafter. The IPO will remain open for public bidding from January 13 to January 16. The allotments will likely be finalized by January 19, and the shares are scheduled to be listed on stock exchanges on January 21.\n\nAmagi Media Labs IPO Anchor Book:\n\nA day before the IPO opened for public bidding, Amagi Media Labs raised Rs 804.87 crore from 42anchor investorson January 12. Out of the total allocation to anchor investors, 1.69 crore equity shares worth Rs 613 crore were allocated to 11 domestic mutual funds including SBI Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, HDFC AMC, Motilal Oswal AMC, Franklin India, PGIM India, and Helios.\n\nInsurance companies like HDFC Life Insurance, Bharti Axa Life Insurance, and Edelweiss Life Insurance also picked up 14.95 lakh shares in Amagi for Rs 53.98 crore.\n\nAnand Rathi advised investors tosubscribe to the issue of the long term. Founded in 2008, Amagi Media Labs are a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company that connects media companies to their audiences through cloud-native technology, the brokerage noted. It added that the company’s platform helps content providers and distributors upload and deliver video over the internet (commonly known as streaming) through smart televisions, smartphones, and applications, instead of traditional cable or set-top box services.\n\nThey also help monetize such content through targeted advertising services for advertisers. Their technology has enabled the streaming of marquee events such as the 2024 Paris Olympics, Union of European Football Association (“UEFA”) football tournaments, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Awards (commonly known as the ‘Oscars’), and the 2024 U.S. Presidential debates.\n\n“At the upper price band, the company is valued at 6.7x FY25 P/S, translating into a post-issue market capitalisation of ₹78,098 million. It has turned profitable in H1 FY26 and, supported by strong operating leverage, is well positioned to deliver full-year profitability in FY26. Continued investments in R&D to enhance scalability, automation, performance, and user experience further reinforce its positioning as the “industry cloud” for video in the media and entertainment space. In light of these factors, the IPO appears fully priced,” Anand Rathi concluded.\n\nAmagi Media Labs represents a very different proposition from most recent Indian IPOs, being a technology-led, SaaS-oriented business with meaningful global exposure, said Prasenjit Paul, Equity Research Analyst & Fund Manager of 129 Wealth Fund. He added that the company operates in a scalable segment driven by programmatic digital advertising and cloud-based media services, which benefit from the ongoing shift of advertising budgets away from traditional television to data-driven and connected-TV platforms. “That gives it long-term growth potential, but also means performance will be driven by execution, client retention and platform economics rather than near-term earnings,” he said.\n\n“The issue pricing appears more grounded compared to earlier private-market valuations, which improves the risk-reward for investors willing to look beyond short-term volatility. However, as with most technology IPOs, valuation sensitivity and the path to sustained profitability remain key considerations, especially in a global advertising cycle that can be uneven. In the current market environment, IPO participation needs to be selective and aligned with individual risk profiles. Capital-intensive, cash-generating businesses and growth-oriented technology companies like Amagi should be evaluated very differently. For investors who already have a stable core portfolio, this IPO can work as a selective growth allocation with a longer-term horizon, rather than a one-size-fits-all or listing-day trade,” the analyst said.\n\nFollow allIPO newshere.",
