  "content": "HCL Technologies’ Q3 FY26 results have strengthened confidence in its operational momentum and deal pipeline, but brokerages are not uniformly bullish on the stock, signalling only a limited near-term upside despite improved earnings visibility.\n\nShares ofHCL Techclosed marginally higher at Rs 1,667 on Monday, up 0.34 percent, ahead of the results. The stock remains down over 16 percent over the past year, underperforming the broader market. That is also a key reason brokerages are tempering enthusiasm even after a strong quarter.\n\nBrokerage commentary broadly agreed that the business is executing well, but valuations and seasonal risks cap upside, advising against aggressive buying at current levels.\n\nWhat worked: Deal wins, guidance upgrade, margins\n\nHCL Tech delivered a strong operational quarter, marked by a 43 percent year-on-year jump in trailing twelve-month deal TCV, improved margins, and a guidance upgrade. Services revenue growth guidance for FY26 was raised to 4.75-5.25 percent in constant currency, placing HCL Tech at the upper end of the peer group.\n\nCiti issued a Neutral rating with a target price of Rs 1,700, noting that HCL Tech’s forward indicators are better than peers, aided by rising headcount and management focus on identifying new spend areas. Citi also raised FY27-FY28 earnings estimates by 2 percent.\n\nHSBC gave a Hold call with a target of Rs 1,815, highlighting that HCL Tech has sustained Q2 momentum into Q3 and now sits at the top end of the peer growth range. HSBC sees operating margins trending towards 18-19 percent in FY27, with a 5-6 percent medium-term revenue CAGR appearing achievable.\n\nWhy caution persists despite a strong quarter\n\nDespite the upbeat fundamentals, brokerages remain wary of near-term performance of HCL Tech shares, citing seasonality, valuation comfort, and historical return patterns.\n\nCLSA kept a Hold rating with a target of Rs 1,661, pointing out that even at the upper end of guidance, Q4 implies negative sequential growth in constant currency, largely due to seasonal weakness in the products business. CLSA also flagged that historically, HCL Tech stock has delivered weak returns between Q4 and Q2, compared with strong gains in the Q2-Q3 period.\n\nThe bullish pocket: AI-led services strategy\n\nThe one clear positive differentiator is HCL Tech’s AI-focused, services-led growth strategy, which is gaining traction.\n\nNomura stood out with a Buy rating and a target price of Rs 1,810, implying an upside of nearly 9 percent. It cited a clear earnings beat, guidance lift, and margin resilience. Nomura views the company’s asset-light, services-centric AI push as structurally positive, while expecting margins to normalise favourably in FY27.\n\nDisclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
