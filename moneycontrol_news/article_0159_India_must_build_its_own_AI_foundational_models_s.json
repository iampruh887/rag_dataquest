  "content": "Vishal Sikka, founder & CEO of Vianai Systems, has called for India to urgently develop its own foundational artificial intelligence models to avoid becoming a passive consumer of technology built elsewhere. In an interview with CNBC TV18, Sikka -- former CEO of Infosys -- emphasised that India is too large and the stakes too high for the nation to be absent from any layer of the AI ecosystem.\n\n\"We have to be central to AI ... at every layer, in every aspect of AI,\" Sikka stated, ahead of the India AI impact summit scheduled for next month. He argued that India possesses the capability to use and deliver AI at scale and should showcase its innovation and entrepreneurial spirit to the world. He said India must build its own foundation models, develop tools and applications on top, and enable hundreds of millions to deploy them, which are the core underpinning for platforms like ChatGPT.\n\nThe former Infosys CEO highlighted a critical skill gap as a major challenge, describing the current global situation as a \"tale of two cities.\" He noted that out of eight billion people worldwide, only about two million can build AI applications. The number shrinks dramatically to a few hundred thousand who can deploy AI in production, and fewer than 25,000 people on the entire planet possess the skills to create a frontier-level foundational model. \"These are not skills that are pre-ordained by God for a chosen few people… we have to really make these skills much more pervasive,\" he said.\n\nTo address this, Sikka, who is on the board of Stanford's AI center, revealed that the upcoming summit will feature faculty from the university who will teach attendees how to build their own foundational models, aiming to proliferate the skill of building foundation models, which he argued can be learned.\n\nSikka outlined a twofold concern regarding India's AI readiness. The first is the urgency to expand the skill base of people who understand AI's capabilities and limitations. The second is the imminent disruptive effect on key industries, particularly the IT services sector. He pointed out that Large Language Models (LLMs) are \"unreasonably effective at writing software,\" posing a direct challenge to traditional software development and maintenance roles. \"We have a short window of time in which to transform from the previous way of doing things to an AI-led way of doing things,\" Sikka warned, framing it as the most important equation for the times ahead.\n\nHe stressed that the disruption is not a future event but is already happening. To illustrate the magnitude of the shift, he shared an anecdote of a complex system that took 15 experts nine months to build being replicated by a single person in just 14 days using modern AI tools. \"It is not a matter of when is it coming. It is here already,\" he asserted.\n\nReflecting on his early decision to back OpenAI with a donation in 2015, he recalled that allocating resources to high-reward, unconventional ideas like these often seem ‘crazy’ at first. He urged a focus on the future, questioning what current opportunities might be missed today that will seem obvious in 2035. For him, the most significant imminent transformation lies in the complete overhaul of the IT landscape driven by AI.",
