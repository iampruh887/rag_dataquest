  "content": "Markets have been reacting sharply to potential US-India trade developments although over short-runs, but Neelkanth Mishra, Chief Economist at Axis Bank, Head of Global Research & Whole Time Director at Axis Capital, expressed surprise at the intensity of the concern. “I am alarmed and amazed at how meaningful people think it is. But I have said this again… the US government will be forced to levy a flat tariff on everyone, in which case there’s no point for India needing ground on anything if there’s no benefit to be had,” he said. The statement underscores a growing divergence between market sentiment and the underlying fundamentals of the Indian economy.\n\nAlongside Mishra, Gautam Chhaochharia of UBS highlighted that India’s fundamentals remain strong, and flows are likely to respond to actual earnings growth rather than headline trade news. Mishra noted that foreign direct investment (FDI) has been inching up, with repatriations rising from USD 20 billion to USD 50 billion per year, and argued that as earnings growth returns to 10 to 15%, India will naturally attract capital flows.\n\nChhaochharia  added that the broader emerging market context matters: FDIs are not just looking at India but at all EMs. “For FDIs to come back in an absolute sense right here, we need earnings growth to pick up. India still represents one of the long-term growth visibility markets for FDIs,” he said. Both strategists suggested that temporary trade noise, including tariffs or delays in US-India agreements, is unlikely to meaningfully deter long-term flows.\n\n“FDIs are not just looking at India — China, Korea, Taiwan, and other EMs are all competing for capital. For flows to shift meaningfully to India, earnings growth and domestic demand need to be durable, not headline-driven,\" said Mishra.\n\nAdding to the discussion, Sajid Chinoy of JP Morgan flagged that markets tend to underestimate Trump-era tariff efficacy. “Now there is section 122, there’s section 232, also 301 and 338… in the US, everything is centralized, an investigation can take 48 hours. So we just need to be a little wary,” he said. Chinoy emphasized that while tariffs or country-specific trade actions create headline risk, the underlying fundamentals of India’s economy, including domestic consumption and credit growth, remain far more important for market performance.\n\nConsumption and Credit as Growth Drivers\n\nThe panel also discussed domestic drivers of growth. Chinoy highlighted that while rural demand and auto sales are showing signs of pickup, “everyone expected this quarter to be strong… the question is, three quarters from now, will we still be seeing consumer durables doing well and will this broaden out beyond autos?” He termed the current uptick a “sugar rush,” emphasizing the need for sustained demand to support private investment and corporate earnings.\n\nChhaochharia  pointed to accelerating credit as a key enabler for consumption and investment. “Monetary tailwind becomes effective when credit growth accelerates. It is only now, in the last fortnight of December, that what used to be 0.8% fortnight over fortnight became 3%. When people borrow, they spend, and that drives the next level,” he said, describing the beginnings of a potential virtuous cycle for the economy.\n\nSectoral and Corporate Implications\n\nOn the earnings front,  Chhaochharia highlighted financials as the most directly poised to benefit from the current cycle, given relatively attractive valuations compared to the last decade. Other sectors, like power, utilities, and equipment, could see growth driven more by stock-specific factors than broad macro trends.\n\nMishra also pointed to the importance of private capex, “Whenever someone says capex is not happening… look at BSE 200 companies’ investing cash flows — it has been growing faster than nominal GDP. Investment is trying to pick up, and the last fortnight of credit growth shows it.”\n\nGautam added that while short-term uncertainties, including tariffs or geopolitical shocks, grab attention, structural trends remain favorable. “This is still the early part of the five-year term for reforms and investment. The roadmap for fiscal consolidation, credit expansion, and domestic consumption sets the stage for sustained growth. If these drivers continue over the next three to four quarters, India’s growth story will play out regardless of headline noise from abroad,” he said.",
