  "content": "The CII’s Business Confidence Index rose to a five-quarter high of 66.5 in Q3 of FY26, thanks to optimism around demand, profitability, and investment conditions, the organisation said in a press release.\n\nDomestic demand remains the key driver for the optimism, with two-thirds of firms reporting higher demand in Q2FY26 and 72 percent expecting further growth in Q3FY26, aided by GST rate cuts and festive consumption, the CII said. \"Investment and hiring intentions remain robust.\"\n\n\"Driven by bold reform initiatives, India has firmly established itself as the world’s fastest‑growing major economy, demonstrating remarkable resilience amid global uncertainty shaped by geopolitical tensions, trade weaponization, and a slowing world economy,\" CII said.\n\nThe organisation is confident that the reform momentum will continue in the forthcoming Union Budget and has made several recommendations as it continues to engage with the policy makers on the next set of reforms.\n\nSustain capex, accelerate digitisation\n\nFor the Budget, CII has recommended sustaining capital expenditure, wherein a revitalised, Rs 150 lakh crore, National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) 2.0 could be launched. \"The focus should be on shovel‑ready, revenue‑generating projects and streamlined dispute‑resolution mechanisms to accelerate infrastructure delivery and crowd‑in private investment,\" it said.\n\n\"In parallel, CII calls for robust Development and Strategic Funding mechanisms to enhance India’s long‑term competitiveness. At the heart of this is the creation of an India Development and Strategic Fund (IDSF), which can be a sovereign‑anchored platform to mobilise large pools of domestic institutional capital and foreign investment,\" it added.\n\nThe IDSF could operate through two complementary arms: a developmental arm to support domestic priorities such as MSMEs, energy transition, and human capital; and a strategic arm to enable overseas acquisitions and partnerships that secure India’s long‑term economic and security interests.\n\nCII also suggests a Rs 1,000‑crore Digitisation Fund, to accelerate India’s regulatory digitisation, advancing the Unified Enterprise Identity, Entity Locker, API‑based compliance, upgraded e‑Gazette and India Code, and a National Compliance Grid, eliminating duplication, enabling real‑time data flows, and creating paperless, presence‑less digital rails that cut compliance burdens and boost ease of doing business.\n\nMoreover, to accelerate innovation and R&D, CII suggests establishing 10 Centres of Advanced Learning and Research (CALRs), each with a budget of Rs 1,000 crore, focused on frontier domains such as AI, quantum, advanced materials, robotics, clean energy, and biotechnology. These could be operated through a public–private co‑funding model with matched industry–government contributions.\n\n\"To strengthen India’s global integration, CII recommends enabling trade and exports through a simplified three‑tier tariff structure, with low tariffs on inputs and moderate tariffs on intermediates, to enhance competitiveness, integrate into global value chains, and promote export diversification,\" CII said.\n\nFinally, on the financial sector front, CII advocates a comprehensive strengthening of India’s banking ecosystem by enhancing the capital base of Development Financial Institutions, enabling selective NBFC‑to‑bank transitions, allowing calibrated foreign equity, encouraging the entry of well‑capitalised new banks, and consolidating weaker institutions to improve scale and efficiency.\n\nAn expert committee, on the lines of the earlier Narsimhan Committees, could be set up to reassess banking structures, ownership and governance norms, capital frameworks, and long-term institutional design for a future ready financial sector, CII said.\n\nAdditionally, to unlock liquidity and attract global capital, CII recommends accelerating asset tokenisation across real estate, infrastructure, and financial assets. “Building on RBI and IFSCA pilots, a National Asset Tokenisation Framework should define clear legal, regulatory, and tax provisions while standardising issuance and trading protocols,” CII said.",
