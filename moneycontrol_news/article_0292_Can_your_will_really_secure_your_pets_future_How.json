Yet very few owners ever pause to think about an uncomfortable question: what happens to the dog or cat if something happens to you?\n\nWho will take them in? Who will pay for food, vet visits and sudden medical emergencies? And can a will really make sure a pet is cared for the way you would want?\n\nThe honest answer is yes — but not in the way most people imagine.\n\nWhy you can’t leave money to your pet\n\nThe first surprise for many pet owners is a legal one. Under Indian law, only a person or a legal entity can inherit property. An animal, no matter how loved, cannot own assets.\n\nSo a line in your will that says, “I leave Rs 5 lakh to my dog,” simply does not work.\n\nWhat you can do is leave money to a person and clearly state that this money is meant to be used only for your pet’s care. That difference may sound technical, but it is what makes the arrangement enforceable rather than just hopeful.\n\nWhat a sensible pet plan in a will looks like\n\nIn practice, a will that properly provides for a pet usually has three parts. First, it names a guardian — the person who will actually take the animal home and look after it.\n\nSecond, it sets aside a specific amount of money or asset to cover the pet’s expenses. This is meant to pay for food, vaccinations, grooming and, just as importantly, medical treatment if something goes wrong.\n\nThird, it gives the executor of the will the job of making sure that this money is used only for the pet. Sometimes this is done by releasing the money in parts rather than all at once.\n\nThis may sound formal, but it is what turns good intentions into something that actually works.\n\nWhy “I trust them” is not a plan\n\nMany people assume that if they leave some money to the person who agrees to take their pet, everything will be fine. Legally, however, that person is under no obligation to spend the money on the animal unless the will clearly says so.\n\nTying the money to a specific purpose — and giving the executor some oversight — reduces the risk that the funds are quietly diverted elsewhere.\n\nHow much should you leave?\n\nThere is no standard number. A young, healthy cat is a very different financial responsibility from an ageing large-breed dog with health issues.\n\nThink in terms of annual costs: food, routine vet visits, vaccinations, grooming and boarding. Then add a buffer for medical emergencies and remember that prices will rise over time. If your pet is young, you may be planning for a decade or more of expenses.\n\nSome people leave a lump sum. Others prefer a more structured arrangement where money is used gradually.\n\nLife is unpredictable. The person you choose as your pet’s guardian today may move abroad, fall ill or simply be unable to take on the responsibility when the time comes.\n\nYour will should name at least one alternate caregiver. And it is always better to have these conversations in advance rather than leaving behind a surprise responsibility.\n\nThe usefulness of a “letter of wishes”\n\nMany pet owners also leave a separate note describing the pet’s habits, food preferences, medical history and daily routine. This is not legally binding, but it can make the transition much easier — and far less stressful for the animal.\n\nIf your will does not mention your pet, the law treats it like any other movable property and passes it on to your legal heirs. There is no obligation on them to keep the animal or care for it in any particular way.\n\nThis is how many pets end up being rehomed or, in the worst cases, abandoned — even when the owner could easily have planned for a different outcome.\n\nYour will can protect your pet’s future, but only if it is written with a bit of care. You cannot make your pet an heir. But you can choose a caregiver, set aside money for its care and build in simple safeguards to make sure that money is actually used for that purpose.\n\nWith a few sensible clauses — and some honest conversations — you can make sure your companion is looked after even when you are no longer around.\n\n1. Can I make my pet a beneficiary in my will?\n\nNo. Under Indian law, a pet cannot own property or inherit assets. You have to leave the money to a person and state clearly that it is meant for the pet’s care.\n\n2. What if the person I name as caregiver can’t take the pet later?\n\nThat is why you should always name at least one backup caregiver. Without one, your pet may end up with your legal heirs by default.\n\n3. How do I make sure the money is actually spent on my pet?\n\nBy linking the funds to a clear purpose in the will and giving the executor the power to oversee or release the money in stages.\n\n4. Do I need a trust for this?\n\nUsually, no. A well-drafted will is enough for most families. A trust only makes sense if the amount involved is large or the arrangements are complicated.\n\n5. What happens if I die without a will?\n\nYour pet becomes part of your movable property and goes to your legal heirs, who are not legally required to keep or care for the animal.",
